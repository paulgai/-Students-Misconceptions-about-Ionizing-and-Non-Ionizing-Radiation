    "abstract": "For good science teaching, it is necessary to have knowledge of your students' preconceptions. Numerous studies have been conducted about typical ideas that students bring to the science classroom in science education research. Unfortunately the domains of which we know preconceptions are not distributed evenly and there is a lack of studies about students' conceptions of electromagnetic radiation. This literature review focuses on the existing body of studies around those conceptions. All studies focusing on conceptions of radiation, including nuclear radiation, have been considered if they were published in international peer reviewed journals in English and German between 1980 and the present day. Some interesting conceptions mentioned in different studies are pointed out, as well as gaps in the literature that need to be filled. At the end, some ideas to conquer misconceptions are presented."

    "abstract": "The teaching of the phenomenon of radioactivity is considered a key ingredient in the path towards developing critical thinking skills in many secondary science education curricula. Despite being one of the basic concepts in general physics courses, the scientific teaching literature of the last 40 years reports a great deal of misconceptions and conceptual errors related to radioactivity that seemingly appear regardless of the educational level and context. This study reports the first cross-sectional diagnostic study in Spain to secondary education students and pre-service teachers. Data were collected in the year 2019 through a questionnaire adapted from a previously validated one to explore the main misconceptions, attitudes, and knowledge status on the topic on a sample of 191 secondary school students and 29 Physics-and-Chemistry trainee teachers in the Spanish region of Valencia. Open and closed questions were used to categorize the entity itself, its properties, and the main misconceptions related to radioactivity. The responses were analysed using conventional statistical methods. The results indicate an evolution from a widespread dissenting notion on the phenomenon, which is staunchly related to danger, hazard, and destruction in the lowest educational levels, towards a more rational, relative, and multidimensional perspective in the highest ones. On the other hand, the ideas, emotions, and attitudes of the inquired individuals are in good agreement with the main misconceptions reported in the literature."

    "abstract": "Walter Faber is a successful scientist. Logic and statistical reasoning determine his thinking.“I’ma technologist and accustomed to seeing things as they are”, is his credo. He seems to be afraid of nothing in the world. When a viper bites his daughter Sabeth, he accepts this fact with irritating calmness.“Did you know,” he asks Sabeth’s mother Hanna,“that the mortality from snake bites is only three to ten percent?” Hanna, on the other hand, reacts with anger and incomprehension:“You and your statistics! If I had a hundred daughters, and all of them had been bitten by a viper, there would be some sense in it.[…] I’ve only got one child.” What is so irritating about Walter Faber? What makes his reaction so inappropriate? It is probably the fact that Faber, fictitious person and protagonist of Max Frisch’s novel Homo Faber (1957), seems to lack a central humane quality: feeling. His exaggerated character of a technologist stands in sharp contrast to Hanna, who seems to react more naturally—and more humanlike. For her, there is no reassurance in the fact that the mortality rate from a snake bite is quite small. It is the possibility rather than the probability that her daughter might die that brings her to the verge of despair. This example highlights that human perception—and risk perception in particular—is determined not only by probability and statistics but also by our fears, worries, and pleasures. There is probably no event or object that we encounter in everyday life toward which we do not experience some immediate feeling—be it a viper, an airplane, or a mobile phone."

The survey aimed to test the understanding of high school students regarding the dangers of radiation exposure from the surrounding environment. Participants in this activity were 48 students (35 science students and 13 social science students) from a high school in Majalaya, Bandung Regency. The instrument used was a two-tier diagnostic test consisting of 4 essay questions related to physics concepts concerning radiation exposure. The analysis of the test results was divided into two parts: conception analysis and Rasch analysis. The conception analysis was done by interpreting students' answers and categorizing them into five conception categories: Full Understanding (FU), Partial Understanding (PU), Misconception (MC), Not Understanding (NU), and No Coding (NC). This categorization was presented in percentage form. The Rasch analysis was conducted based on the distribution of students' answers and item bias detection to identify the spread of students' answers to each question item and the biases present. First, the conception analysis results showed that 53% of students were included in the FU category, while only 5% were in the Not Understanding (NU) category. This indicates that students' understanding of the dangers of radiation exposure is quite good, as more than half of the participants are in the FU category. Second, the Rasch analysis results based on the distribution of students' answers showed that more students could answer basic comprehension questions compared to classification and analysis-based questions. Additionally, the Rasch analysis results based on item bias detection indicated that there was no gender or academic major bias in the four question items."

Do they perceive danger and risks? Do they know how to protect themselves? What do they think of various applications of ionizing radiation? Where and how does the public lodge confidence or doubt? What is the demand for information and transparency? We applied the mental models approach to investigate these questions in four European countries (France, Poland, Romania, and Slovenia; 63 respondents), providing a rich picture of how the lay public perceives ionizing radiation. Mental models are messy and overlapping but meaningful and useful schemas, resulting from a person's multidimensional experience and relation to the surrounding natural and social world. Collectively, members of the lay public (independently of their education or background) possess a non-negligible amount of knowledge on the topic of ionizing radiation risk, and hold strong views on related concepts. Mutual understanding between specialists and potentially affected citizens may be a critical pathway to build a shared and effective risk culture supported by accurate, two-way risk communication and inter-actor relationships."

In an explorative study, the perceptions of 50 high school students were examined using semi-structured interviews. The students were 14–16 years old and were chosen from 7 different high schools in an urban area in Austria. Following an interview guideline, students were asked about their general associations with the term ‘radiation’ as well as about their general understanding of different types of radiation. A qualitative analysis of these interviews following the method of Flick (2009) revealed that the students’ associations were, to a great extent, very different from the scientific use of the term. Several conceptions that could inhibit students’ learning processes could be identified. Consequences for the teaching of the topic ‘radiation’ in science lessons, which are based on these preconceptions, are presented in the conclusion."

However, it can be difficult to ensure a safe working environment.\nIn the late 1980s and 1990s, the Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) became aware of a problem related to its working environment. Concern regarding the safety on-board a missile torpedo boat (MTB)–the “Kongelig Norsk Marine (KNM) Kvikk”–arose after a meeting between two fathers at an orthopaedic clinic in Bergen, Norway. Both had served on-board this vessel and both were accompanying their sons to a control medical examination for club foot. They began discussing their service in the Navy and their sons’ anomalies, and they learned that even more children with parents who had served on this vessel had congenital anomalies. To investigate this topic further, the RNoN ordered specific surveys regarding this vessel1-3 to find the reason for these anomalies. The parents suspected that the special working environment of the vessel might be the cause. The “KNM Kvikk” operated as a leading vessel of the MTB command, and had specific tasks in electronic warfare. The vessel was therefore equipped with high powered high frequency jamming sending equipment operating at as high as 750 Watt (W) output power. Also the operating pattern of the “KNM Kvikk” was different from the other MTB vessels in the RNoN1, 3 in that it would lie more still, for instance, than the other vessels when carrying out electronic warfare. This might have entailed different degrees of exposure compared to that of other personnel in the Navy."

ICNIRP Guidelines propose exposure limits for electromagnetic fields in the frequency range up to 300 GHz based on short-term exposures and on thermal effects. The new EC proposal for optical and laser safety legislation includes classification of sources of radiation—both lasers and other optical sources, but not requirements for the methodology of classification. On the other hand, many new requirements have been set by the WHO publication “Model Legislation for EMF Protection” concerning the responsibilities in the field of EMF health and safety. Many specialists in the field of developing exposure limits have positions very far away from the proposed of the ICNIRP Guidelines philosophy. The results are different approaches in developing standards and exposure limits, and differences more than 100 times in maximal permissible levels. We, the Bulgarian Program Committee on NIR, try to organize working groups and discuss different philosophy for developing exposure limits for more than 10 years. This paper exposes our position in this area."

This comprehensive review examines these misconceptions, analyzing their origins–including inadequate education, the complexity of EMR concepts, media misrepresentation, and educators’ own misunderstandings–and their impact on scientific literacy and public health. By reviewing a wide range of scientific studies, we identify common misunderstandings, such as conflating ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, believing all radiation is harmful, and confusing irradiation with contamination. These misconceptions contribute to unwarranted health anxieties, resistance to beneficial technologies, and challenges in science education. We highlight the critical need for effective EMR education through curriculum integration, innovative teaching methods, and enhanced teacher training. By addressing these misconceptions through strategic educational reforms and evidence-based communication, we aim to foster a scientifically literate society capable of making informed decisions about EMR and its applications."

    "abstract": "Background\nOur society is increasingly using equipment that produces and emits non-ionizing electromagnetic fields (EMF), and little is known regarding exposure to such fields and the possible impact on male reproductive health. The main objective of this thesis is to gain more knowledge regarding the possible influence of nonionizing EMFs on male reproduction.\nMaterial and methods\nThe Royal Norwegian Navy (RNoN) had specific concerns regarding non-ionizing EMFs and reproductive health, as there were worries related to work on-board a specific vessel, namely the “Kongelig Norsk Marine (KNM) Kvikk”. Papers I and II were the result of cross-sectional studies conducted among all employees in the RNoN in 2002 by means of questionnaires. Paper I used self-reported exposures, and the questionnaire included variables regarding work history, physical health characteristics, education, diseases and reproductive health. In paper II the same questionnaire was used, and an expert panel categorized 18 work categories among the military men in the RNoN in terms of exposure or non-exposure to non-ionizing EMFs. Paper III was a dosimeter study on electric (E) fields on-board two vessels in the RNoN, a missile-torpedo boat (MTB) and a submarine. Personnel on-board wore the instrument in their breast pocket during their shifts and answered questions regarding location on-board and work tasks performed. In addition, the vessel’s activity and use of non-ionizing EMF-emitting equipment was noted. Paper IV was a prospective randomized balanced cross-over study of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and influence on hormones relevant for male reproduction. Twenty-four male medical students who met a number of inclusion criteria were investigated by means of serum-blood samples immediately before and after a real and sham MRI investigation.\nResults\nResponse rate in the cross-sectional studies (Paper I and II) was 58 per cent (n=2265) among all personnel (military and civilian personnel) and 63 per cent (n=1487) among the military men. The prevalence ratio (PR) of having a child with congenital anomaly was 4.0 (confidence interval (CI) 1.9 - 8.6) among the personnel who had served on-board the “KNM Kvikk”. Among the same personnel, the PR of having a stillborn child or a child that died within one week of birth was 4.1 (CI 1.7 - 9.9). In paper II, three work categories were classified as exposed to non-ionizing EMFs: “tele/communication”, “radar/sonar” and “electronics”. Logistic regression adjusted for age, whether the subject had ever smoked, military education and physical exercise at work displayed an increased odds ratio (OR) of 1.72 (CI 1.04 - 2.85) among “tele/communication” workers and OR of 2.28 (CI 1.27 - 4.09) among “radar/sonar” workers for self-reported infertility compared to unexposed workers. “Electronics” did not display an increased OR for self-reported infertility compared to the unexposed workers. In paper III, a total of 56 measurements were conducted on Efields on-board two vessels in the RNoN. The E-field values measured were very low, averaging 0 – 10 per cent of the guidelines given by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP). In paper IV, there was no change seen in hormone levels either immediately after exposure or within the next 11 days when persons exposed to real and sham MRI were compared.\nConclusion\nPaper I displayed an increased PR for having children with congenital anomalies, stillbirths or perinatal deaths after having served on-board a specific MTB vessel in the RNoN.

    "abstract": "Background Many students carry negative beliefs about nuclear radiation and have concerns regarding the safety of nuclear power. However, most of these students have not had any personal or educational experiences with nuclear radiation or reactors on which to form these opinions.\nPurpose To examine the influence that a visit to a nuclear reactor could have upon students’, the impact of a reactor’s outreach program on students’ attitudes toward nuclear power and their scientific knowledge about nuclear radiation and reactors was explored.\nProgram description The students in this study visited a research and teaching reactor on a university campus. Instructed by reactor staff, they participated in a series of hands-on activities that explored and explained ionizing radiation, and they toured the reactor facilities.\nSample The subjects were 32 students, 13–14 years of age, from a rural area of the United States.\nDesign and methods The students were surveyed before and after the program using open-ended and Likert scale items, and were asked to complete a nuclear science version of the Draw-A-Scientist-Test.\nResults The findings indicate that the students’ attitudes toward nuclear radiation and nuclear power became more positive and judicious after visiting the reactor, and there was a corresponding increase in student knowledge about nuclear reactors and nuclear radiation. Before the program, some of the students carried common scientific misconceptions about nuclear power and nuclear radiation, and the outreach was successful in challenging those misconceptions if they were directly addressed.\nConclusions Increased instruction on the topics of nuclear radiation and reactors led students to have views on these topics that were more knowledgeable and discriminating. The results imply that outreach programs at reactors can be valuable in terms of educating students and developing their attitudes toward nuclear power and nuclear radiation."

The evaluation of RF radiation health risks from 5G technology is ignored in a report by a government expert group in Switzerland and a recent publication from The International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection. Conflicts of interest and ties to the industry seem to have contributed to the biased reports. The lack of proper unbiased risk evaluation of the 5G technology places populations at risk. Furthermore, there seems to be a cartel of individuals monopolizing evaluation committees, thus reinforcing the no-risk paradigm.

    "abstract": "Radiofrequency (RF) radiation in the frequency range of 30 kHz‑300 GHz is classified as a ‘possible’human carcinogen, Group 2B, by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) since 2011. The evidence has since then been strengthened by further research; thus, RF radiation may now be classified as a human carcinogen, Group 1. In spite of this, microwave radiations are expanding with increasing personal and ambient exposure. One contributing factor is that the majority of countries rely on guidelines formulated by the International Commission on Non‑Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), a private German non‑governmental organization. ICNIRP relies on the evaluation only of thermal (heating) effects from RF radiation, thereby excluding a large body of published science demonstrating the detrimental effects caused by non‑thermal radiation. The fifth generation, 5G, for microwave radiation is about to be implemented worldwide in spite of no comprehensive investigations of the potential risks to human health and the environment. In an appeal sent to the EU in September, 2017 currently> 260 scientists and medical doctors requested for a moratorium on the deployment of 5G until the health risks associated with this new technology have been fully investigated by industry‑independent scientists. The appeal and four rebuttals to the EU over a period of> 2 years, have not achieved any positive response from the EU to date. Unfortunately, decision makers seem to be uninformed or even misinformed about the risks. EU officials rely on the opinions of individuals within the ICNIRP and the Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR), most of whom have ties to the industry. They seem to dominate evaluating bodies and refute risks. It is important that these circumstances are described. In this article, the warnings on the health risks associated with RF presented in the 5G appeal and the letters to the EU Health Commissioner since September, 2017 and the authors' rebuttals are summarized. The responses from the EU seem to have thus far prioritized industry profits to the detriment of human health and the environment."

    "abstract": "We all face risks in a variety of ways, as individuals, businesses and societies. The discipline of risk assessment and risk management is growing rapidly and there is an enormous drive for the implementation of risk assessment methods and risk management in organizations. There are great expectations that these tools provide suitable frameworks for obtaining high levels of performance and balance different concerns such as safety and costs. The analysis and management of risk are not straightforward. There are many challenges. The risk discipline is young and there area a number of ideas, perspectives and conceptions of risk out there. For example many analysts and researchers consider it appropriate to base their risk management policies on the use of expected values, which basically means that potential losses are multiplied with their associated consequences. However, the rationale for such a policy is questionable. A number of such common conceptions of risk are examined in the book, related to the risk concept, risk assessments, uncertainty analyses, risk perception, the precautionary principle, risk management and decision making under uncertainty. The Author discusses these concepts, their strenghts and weaknesses, and concludes that they are often better judged as misconceptions of risk than conceptions of risk. Key Features: Discusses common conceptions of risk with supporting examples. Provides recommendations and guidance to risk analysis and risk management. Relevant for all types of applications, including engineering and business. Presents the Author’s overall conclusions on the issues addressed throughout the book. All those working with risk-related problems need to understand the fundamental ideas and concepts of risk. Professionals in the field of risk, as well as researchers and graduate sutdents will benefit from this book. Policy makers and business people will also find this book of interest."

    "abstract": "Medical radiation is vital in acquiring a patient diagnosis, but some clinicians are concerned with the perceived risks associated with ionizing radiation. This risk is heightened when incorporating in utero exposures due to the risk to the developing foetus. Although other organ systems have been studied, there is a paucity of data on the effects to the respiratory system from in utero exposures. The aim of this thesis was to understand the long-term effects on the respiratory system from in utero exposures, but as a first step, it was important to determine what levels patients receive whilst admitted to hospital. Two polar populations were chosen based on their predicted exposure levels during hospitalisation; one with high levels, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and one with low levels, pregnant patients. Most patients cumulatively received < 1mSv with median exposures of 0.99 mSv (ICU patients) and 0.02 mSv (pregnant patients). However, both cohorts had patients that surpassed 10 mSv. To assess the effects from in utero exposures on the respiratory system, two animal models were conducted both exposed during late gestation, one healthy model and one acute lung injury model. In the health animal model, cardiovascular outcomes were also measured, however, ionizing radiation (50, 300, 1000 mGy) did not appear to influence these two organ systems from the outcomes measured. In the acute lung injury model, lipopolysaccharide (3mg/Kg) stimulated an acute lung inflammatory response, however, there was also no overt effect of radiation from the outcomes measured (10, 100, 1000 mGy). In both models, ionizing radiation did cause growth restriction up to 16 weeks of age, but this was only observed from doses above 100 mGy. Overall, the levels of ionizing radiation patients receive is low and from diagnostic exposures during pregnancy, there does not appear to be any strong effects on the developing foetus."

    "abstract": "Introduction\nMRI is a major advancement in the diagnostic imaging field. Due to the absence of ionizing radiation, MRI has traditionally been regarded as a safe imaging technique. Nonetheless, there exist environmental hazards that are associated with it, and it is imperative for healthcare practitioners to acknowledge and mitigate them. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of Faculty Applied Medical Science (FAMS) students at Jazan University toward MRI safety.\nMethods\nThis was a descriptive cross-sectional study carried out at the FAMS. Data were collected through a questionnaire consisting of 15 yes-or-no questions.\nResults\nA total of 314 students (69.1% males, 30.9% females) responded to this cross-sectional survey. Around half of the sample (51%) were from diagnostic radiology department. Most students (83%) correctly identified MRI as a technique using a magnetic field but there were knowledge gaps regarding MRI-compatible devices. Despite the lack of prior experience, a significant proportion of students demonstrated knowledge regarding contraindications of metals and screening requirements. Significant differences were found based on age groups (<0.05), with variations in understanding MRI zones and the feasibility of pregnancy scans (<0.05). Gender differences were observed in knowledge about MRI scanning for patients with tattoos and prohibited items in the MRI room (p < .05).\nConclusion\nThis study found that FAMS students demonstrated a significant level of awareness regarding potential hazards within the MRI environment. However, there was a notable knowledge gap regarding the functioning of the MRI device, as some students incorrectly believed it utilized ionizing radiation and could be deactivated after procedures. These findings highlight the importance of enhancing education and training on MRI safety, including accurate knowledge about MRI technology and its potential risks. By addressing these knowledge gaps, future healthcare professionals can contribute to ensuring the safety of patients and staff during MRI procedures."

This study is part continuation part replication of the studies carried out by Neumann and Hopf (2013). The method employed in both studies was identical. 459 students drew pictures associated with the concept “radiation” under observation. The resulting motives were subsequently categorized and compared. In this study the children barely associate the concept of “radiation” with the Fukushima Nuclear Disaster. Moreover, a number of differences could be realized when compared to the reference study. For instance, significantly more students drew cell phones and computer monitors in the current study. Additionally, a greater number of drawings related to radioactivity could be observed. Overall, the findings of this work indicate that not only are students exposed to the media at a much younger age, but also more frequently.

    "abstract": "Medical diagnostic imaging tests that produce ionizing radiation now deploy technology that captures an individual patient’s cumulative radiation dose. This raises the question of whether there is an imperative for regional health authorities to disclose this information to physicians who may then engage their patients in decisions about whether the potential harms are worth the benefits of subsequent diagnostic imaging. Currently, the advice of the professional bodies providing standards of practice for medical diagnostic imaging is to withhold this information from physicians. Their concern is that cumulative dose information is difficult to evaluate in terms of risk to individual patients; it is not easily applicable to clinical decision making about the appropriateness of a subsequent imaging exam; and referring clinicians will feel compelled to offer a patient a less efficacious non-ionizing test, which could negatively affect patient care. We present a critical analysis of several assumptions underlying the stance of non-disclosure. Working at the intersection of medical physics, medical anthropology, and clinical ethics, we offer an alternative framing of the discourse of risk that has shaped the recent scholarly debate on disclosure of individual cumulative radiation dose. We posit that a persuasive argument can be made against the stance of the professional bodies and for a policy of disclosure – provided that such a policy prioritizes patient-centred shared decision making, radiologists as risk-interpretation experts, and the authority of the prescribing physician."

However, due to a variety of issues, such as disparities in educational resources, differing emphasis on science education, cultural attitudes, and language obstacles, students in Latin America, including Ecuador, have a limited understanding of modern physics. The present work exposes a pre-test methodology to evaluate students' knowledge and pinpoint their areas of weakness. The analysis of the results indicates that most students received lower grades, while a smaller proportion obtained higher scores. Our findings reveal significant knowledge gaps, misconceptions, and uncertainty among the participants regarding various topics related to the constituent and stability of the nucleus, quantum behavior, nuclear models, radioactive decay, and natural radioactive sources. Additionally, it was statistically demonstrated (Kruskal-Wallis H test) that misconceptions, uncertainties, and knowledge gaps are not significantly related to learning styles. The type of college substantially impacts academics, with private university students typically receiving higher grades. These results offer insightful information about student performance, how learning styles and college types affect academic achievement in modern physics, and the effects of living area and academic level."

The participants simulated the radioactive decay process of an imaginary radioactive element called Cornium during the laboratory modelling activity. In this way, pre-service chemistry teachers were able to visualize and model what is meant by radioactive decay and half-life. Data sources included responses given to open-response conceptual questions, participants’ drawings about radioactive decay and half-life, semi-structured interviews, activity worksheets, and observation notes. Qualitative analysis of data revealed that the pre-service chemistry teachers had misconceptions about the definition of radioactive elements/atoms, radioactive decay, and the half-life process before the activity. The role of the modelling activity in exposing and eliminating these misconceptions was discussed."

    "abstract": "As use of imaging in the evaluation of pregnant and lactating patients continues to increase, misperceptions of radiation and safety risks have proliferated, which has led to often unwarranted concerns among patients and clinicians. When radiologic examinations are appropriately used, the benefits derived from the information gained usually outweigh the risks. This review describes appropriateness and safety issues, estimated doses for imaging examinations that use iodizing radiation (ie, radiography, computed tomography, nuclear scintigraphy, and fluoroscopically guided interventional radiology), radiation risks to the mother and conceptus during various stages of pregnancy, and use of iodinated or gadolinium-based contrast agents and radiotracers in pregnant and lactating women. Maternal radiation risk must be weighed with the potential consequences of missing a life-threatening diagnosis such as pulmonary embolus. Fetal risks (ie, spontaneous abortion, teratogenesis, or carcinogenesis) vary with gestational age and imaging modality and should be considered in the context of the potential benefit of medically necessary diagnostic imaging. When feasible and medically indicated, modalities that do not use ionizing radiation (eg, magnetic resonance imaging) are preferred in pregnant and lactating patients. Radiologists should strive to minimize risks of radiation to the mother and fetus, counsel patients effectively, and promote a realistic understanding of risks related to imaging during pregnancy and lactation.\n©RSNA, 2015"

The current study examines ways in which parents of school-age children perceive the issue of Wi-Fi radiation in schools by using a science literacy framework that examined engagement with Wi-Fi as a socio-scientific issue. In this messy epistemological space, where parents are faced with too much information of uneven quality, the science literacy literature expects them to reach an informed decision. This mixed-method study includes interviews (study I, n = 35) and questionnaires (study II, n = 513) with parents to explore their attitudes, decisions, and justifications regarding questions about Wi-Fi in schools. The interviews demonstrated heuristics and shortcuts used for decision-making. Considerations often did not include in-depth investigation or scientific knowledge. The questionnaire further examined the patterns identified in the interviews and how they related to socio-demographics and scientific background. Findings indicate that neither scientific reasoning nor relevant knowledge was necessarily connected with the decisions made or the justification given by the parents. This should be of interest to future educational programs focusing on promoting science literacy for informed citizenship."

Because an implicit or explicit value judgment accompanies the term “non-invasive,” it has been used to promote technological progress, especially new brain-imaging techniques that have appeared in recent decades. This study’s material comes from interactions between some expert scientists and the political sphere. Expert reports on neuroscience from different advisory bodies in the French public sector have been collected and analyzed for use of the distinction between invasive and non-invasive. The paper shows that the meaning of these widely used labels varies according to the context, e.g., status of discourse, technologies compared, or stakeholders engaged in the discussion. The definition of what is understood as invasive or non-invasive becomes a strategic issue and can thus vary according to the methodologies favoured by experts participating in national advisory boards or councils."

This paper aims to present Africa’s position regarding quality and safety in imaging, give reasons for the rising interest in quality and safety, define quality and safety from an African context, list drivers for quality and safety in Africa, discuss the impact of COVID-19 on quality and safety, and review Africa’s progress using the Bonn Call for Action framework while proposing a way forward for imaging quality and safety in Africa. In spite of a healthcare setting characterized by meagre financial, human and technology resources, a rapidly widening disease-burden spectrum, growing proportion of non-communicable diseases and resurgence of tropical and global infections, Africa has over the last ten years made significant strides in quality and safety for imaging. These include raising radiation-safety awareness, interest and application of evidence-based radiation safety recommendations and guidance tools, establishing facility and national diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) and strengthening end-user education and training. Major challenges are: limited human resource, low prioritization of imaging in relation to other health services, low level of integration of imaging into the entire health service delivery, insufficient awareness for radiation safety awareness, a radiation safety culture which is emerging, insufficient facilities and opportunities for education and training. Solutions to these challenges should target the entire hierarchy of health service delivery from prioritization, policy, planning, processes to procedures."

The aim of this study is to elicit the Turkish physics teachers’ views of the ‘radiation’ subject in the current textbooks. To collect data, semi-structured interviews were conducted with twelve teachers working in different high schools. The data were presented using tables with quatotions. The findings showed that the teachers were mostly familiar with the ‘radiation’ subject in the textbooks. They stated that the curriculum insufficiently involved the ‘radiation’ subject. Further, they addressed that the textbooks minimally referred to the subject since the university entrance examination does not cover the radiation-related questions. Teachers also depicted that they had limited subject matter knowledge of radiation and found it difficult for teaching their students. Moreover, they thought that integrating more radiation subjects into the current textbooks would be beneficial for them and their students. The current study suggests that the scope of the ‘radiation’ subject in the textbooks should be extended. Furthermore, a new physics curriculum ought to be interactively developed by the help of the teachers."

RSIs play a significant role in the transnational regulatory process by mediating between the scientific community and policy-making bodies. I argue that RSIs have a hybrid structure involving both political-legal and epistemic authority. The hybrid structure of RSIs – their capacity to exert both normative and epistemic authority – constitutes an innovative response to the demand of modern society for scientific certainty and to the scarcity of normative power in the international domain. This hybrid nature has a triple structure involving three complementary pairs: law~science, law~non-law and science~pseudoscience. I examine the way in which RSIs cope with the challenge of maintaining their epistemic and legal authority against the tensions generated by their hybrid structure. The discussion of hybrid authority is related to the problem of scientific uncertainty. I examine this theoretical argument drawing on an in-depth analysis of three RSIs that reflect the institutional diversity of the RSI network: the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection and the European Committee of Homeopaths. I conclude with a discussion of some of the policy issues associated with the institutional design of RSIs. The policy discussion refers, first, to the risk posed by RSIs’ hybrid structure to their internal stability and, second, to some potential adverse social impacts that need to be considered alongside RSIs’ projected benefits."

We present a novel approach to implementing an introductory RO didactic lecture to second-year medical students by interweaving associated oncological and ionizing radiation content represented on the United States Medical Licensing Exam® (USMLE®) Step 1 examination. Students had synchronous and asynchronous opportunities to engage with the 1.0-h didactic lecture administered by an attending Radiation Oncologist faculty member. Students were electronically invited to anonymously rank the effectiveness of the lecture materials on a 5-point Likert scale. Performance on standardized board-style questions regarding radiation biology and radiation side effects was recorded before and after the lecture and compared to the historic performance of previous institutional second-year medical student cohorts. The lecture material effectiveness received a mean score of 4.50 on a 5-point Likert scale. There was a statistically significant improvement in student performance on a board-style radiation side effect question from 39% on a pretest to 76% on a posttest. A USMLE® topic-based approach may be an effective way to implement a formalized introduction to RO to preclinical medical students while simultaneously improving performance on relevant standardized board-style questions. Providing evidence that RO topics appear on the USMLE® Step 1 examination curriculum was a powerful incentive for implementation when negotiating with curriculum offices."

    "abstract": "Digital wireless technologies increasingly employ radiofrequency non-ionizing radiation (NIR/RFR) for wireless communication. Early wireless technology innovation focused on military, aviation, and telecommunication applications, such as radar and microwave communications. However, the 1980s saw the rollout of commercial consumer-oriented wireless cellular telecommunications systems. While concerns on adverse health effects from exposure to RFR emerged in the military-industrial context in the 1950s, it was not until the early 1990s that there was an institutional response to calls for health and safety protection guidelines. Unfortunately, these guidelines were based on NIR/RFR thermal risks only—the science and technology experts ignored and dismissed a considerable body of research finding adverse health effects from non-thermal exposures. By 2020, that body of research had grown considerably. Yet, for reasons that are unclear to concerned scientists, guidelines from the 1990s remain unchanged. This study conducts a path constitution analysis (PCA) and a retrospective ethical risk analysis (eRA) to help foster an understanding of how historical guidelines were arrived at and why they remain immutable to change. The study finds potentially unethical behaviour in a variety of institutional and organisational actors, the consequence of which is a significant risk to the health and wellbeing of adults and children."

Despite increasing evidence of serious negative effects from radiofrequency radiation on human health and the environment, the EU has not acknowledged that there are any risks. Since September 2017, seven appeals by scientists and medical doctors have been sent to the EU requesting a halt to the roll-out of the fifth generation of wireless communication (5G). The millimeter waves (MMW) and complex waveforms of 5G contribute massively harmful additions to existing planetary electromagnetic pollution. Fundamental rights and EU primary law make it mandatory for the EU to protect the population, especially children, from all kinds of harmful health effects of wireless technology. However, several experts associated with the WHO and the EU have conflicts of interest due to their ties to industry. The subsequent prioritizing of economic interests is resulting in human and planetary health being compromised. Experts must make an unbiased evaluation with no conflicts of interest. The seven appeals to the EU have included requests for immediate protective action, which have been ignored. On the issue of wireless radiation and the health of citizens, the EU seems to be another hard nut to crack."

The aim of this article is to determine the field strengths of popular mobile devices and to analyse their compliance in light of both legal safety limits and third-party precautionary limits. The importance of minimizing the exposure to the electromagnetic fields where possible is stressed by recent scientific evidence and also by the high level European bodies. The measurements are conducted using a novel 14-point measurement model, covering the entire body of the user. The measurement results show that the strongest fields are produced by a tablet PC, a smartphone and a netbook when they are connected to the network via EDGE or GPRS technologies. Significantly less exposure is obtained from the devices that utilize WLAN network connection or 3G within excellent network reception. At the same time, the least strong radiofrequency electromagnetic field is produced when using the e-reader or desktop PC. Based on the results, solutions are suggested to minimize the users’ field exposure while retaining the network connectivity."

    "abstract": "The strong international regime that has emerged for radiation protection offers lessons that we should apply to other technologies and knowledge-based subjects. An epistemic group of global experts, specialists within this group, challenges from other professional institutions, and public pressure generated radiation protection norms that ensure benefits while limiting risks. These factors encouraged the growth of a resilient international regime that still persists today with no legal authority but universal legitimacy, even if implementation is sometimes incomplete. Epistemic groups of global experts might also bring results for issues like air pollution and toxic chemicals, ozone depleting and climate change gases, nonionizing radiation, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and vaccines, artificial intelligence, genome editing, and arms control. Managing these issues requires balancing risks and benefits. Where such epistemic groups do not emerge, adversarial processes dominate. They make it far harder to reach reasonable outcomes that protect people and the environment as well as the technological enterprises that generate risks. Use of epistemic groups of global experts for non-technological but knowledge-rich subjects is also imaginable, but it does not often happen. In at least some instances, it should."

I argue that mediation of cell towers in newspapers and lifestyle shows as potentially emitting cancer-causing radiation was key to shaping public perceptions about them. Through their disruptive nature, cell towers call into action a technoscience public consisting of a variety of stakeholders, including radio-frequency scientists, cellular operators, journalists, tower builders, activists, municipal corporations, and building owners. Technoscience publics and media publics intersect and shape each other, and this article presents “mediated technoscience public” as a theoretical framework for an ethnographic intervention in media studies. This framework involves the tracking and comparison of media coverage about technological infrastructure as well as the ways humans emotionally perceive and interact with those infrastructures."

Most of the physical phantoms have explicit properties and have been manufactured to simulate tissues for specific measurements in diagnostic or treatment energy ranges of ionizing radiation. In addition, mathematical phantoms have become extremely popular and are used in all parts of radiation physics applications. Direct dosimetric methods using either a thermoluminescence (TL) technique or optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) technique or any other method using passive solid-state detectors, have also been used for the estimation of absorbed doses for both patients and personnel in radiotherapy, diagnostic radiology and nuclear medicine applications."

Through purposive sampling, 24 laywomen (women with and without BC) and 10 experts of different fields including oncology, surgery, gynecology and reproductive health were selected. Data collection was carried out using semi-structured interviews, which was mainly focused on the participants’ understanding and perception of BC risk factors. The data was analyzed utilizing conventional content analysis developed by Graneheim & Lundman. Components of trustworthiness, including credibility, dependability, confirmability, and transferability were considered.\nResults\nThe main category of risk factors, which emerged from the lay participants’ data analysis, were “unhealthy lifestyle and habits” , “hormonal influences”, “environmental exposures”, “Individual susceptibility “and “belief in supernatural powers”. The experts had similar perspectives for certain risk factors, yet not for all. The category of “Individual history of disease” was emerged only from experts’ interviews.\nConclusion\nIn the present study, the lay participants’ perception concerning BC risk factors was found to be a mixture of cultural beliefs and the scientific knowledge dispersed by the media, internet, and health services. Primary prevention approaches, including awareness of breast cancer risk factors, are required for women to make improved health-related choices."

    "abstract": "Background: Infertility is a pressing concern globally, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, where cultural preferences for high fertility exacerbate its impact. While both gender (female and male) factors contribute to infertility, male infertility is often overlooked despite accounting for a significant portion of cases. In Sub-Saharan Africa, infertility prevalence varies widely, with notable percentage (40%–50%) reported in Nigeria. Cultural norms often place emphasis on male offspring, adding pressure on couples facing infertility. Despite its profound psychosocial impact, infertility care, especially for men, is limited in developing countries like Nigeria. This study explored the knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices towards the causes of male infertility amongst urology outpatients in Wuse District Hospital (WDH) and Asokoro District Hospital (ADH), Abuja, Nigeria.\nMethods: A quantitative study was carried out amongst urology outpatients in ADH and WDH. Pre-tested questionnaires were distributed to 200 male urology outpatients. The study was analyzed by summary statistics and a test of association (Chi-square test) was carried out with SPSS 20.\nResults: Respondents demonstrated a modest understanding of the factors that contribute to male infertility (130 (67.40%)), with only a small percentage exhibiting good knowledge (15 (7.8%)). Low sperm count and the impact of sexually transmitted infections were widely recognized, misconceptions regarding supernatural causes like witchcraft persisted among a significant proportion of respondents (58 (30.40%)). Attitudes towards male infertility varied, with a notable proportion expressing openness and reduced stigma surrounding the condition. The majority of respondents advocated for joint investigation of infertility issues within couples, indicating a shared responsibility approach. Practices related to seeking help for male infertility revealed a preference for spiritual interventions over medical treatments, reflecting the strong influence of religion in Nigeria.\nConclusions: The study’s outcomes reflect the complexity of beliefs and practices surrounding male infertility in the study population, emphasizing the necessity of culturally competent healthcare practices and focused educational initiatives to dispel misconceptions and promote reproductive health literacy."

The high-ionization particles generated by these collisions, such as gold or carbon ions and protons, may introduce radiation effects into the MVD sensors, such as: single-event effects (SEE), total ionization dose (TID) effects and displacement damages. In this thesis, we derive a method to implement radiation-hardening-by-design (RHBD) without compromising the essential features of the CMOS circuits, essentially its size. Using dedicated simulations and considering critical functionalities, we selectively introduced RHDB in two digital parts of the MVD sensor prototype, hardening them considerably against SEE : the read-out architecture and a phase-locked loop circuit."

From the well-being of the mother derives the well-being of the fetus, and therefore, radiologists, radiation physicists, and physicians must evaluate the possible effects of each imaging modality on the fetus, along with the necessity of the examination for the mother, in order to expedite indicated imaging studies and avoid nonessential exams. Knowledge of the benefits and potential risks of radiological studies used for assessing illnesses in pregnancy can help in selecting an appropriate imaging study for the evaluation of a pregnant woman. This is of particular importance as recent studies have reported that physicians who care for pregnant women and do not perform an evaluation of potential risks may recommend an abortion on the basis of an overestimated teratogenic risk from radiological studies. 1, 2 Misconceptions regarding the use of imaging in pregnancy can also delay necessary and urgent radiological studies in pregnant women and increase anxiety in pregnant patients seeking counseling. 3, 4 Therefore, experienced and well-trained physicians, health physicists, and geneticists who are familiar with the fields of developmental biology, teratology, epidemiology, and genetics must counsel pregnant women or the parents of a child with congenital malformations to avoid excessive emphasis on epidemiological data that may be meager or insufficient for a rational conclusion. 5 When facing the dilemma of imaging studies in pregnancy, a “Combination of uncertainty and radiation is the formula for actuating anxiety and fear.” 6 And,“Education is usually the answer to fear of the unknown, but it is not an easy task when the subject is radiation.” 6"

This approach elucidated the ordering instruments that operated at the nexus of the social and the natural in making institutions, identities, discourses, and representations, and the sociotechnical imaginaries animating the use of those instruments, that culminated in a regulatory system centered on the linear no-threshold dose-response model and the As Low As Reasonably Achievable philosophy."

A range of existing cogeneration processes explores the use of waste stream process heat for a variety of processes including district heating and desalination. However, the direct application of under-utilized ionization energy has yet to be fully realized. This thesis is a study on the potential application of ionizing radiation from nuclear facilities towards the radiolytic production of organic chemicals derived from waste renewable feedstocks. Here we show that glycerol, a notable waste feedstock from biodiesel production can be converted into acetol (hydroxyacetone) or solketal which are textile and biofuel additives, respectively using ionizing radiation from a 250-kW research fission reactor. The radical-initiated chain reaction for hydroxyl acetone (acetol) production is optimised to produce the highest G value (2.7±0.4 µmol J− 1) and mass productivity (~ 1%) to be reported in the available radiolysis literature. A previously unreported radiolytic product, solketal, which is a valuable biofuel additive is produced radiolytically using ternary glycerol, acetone, and water mixtures with G-values of 1.5±0.2 µmol J− 1 at 50 kGy. Empirical data showed a preference for low LET, low dose rate, γ-ray emissions such as those from spent fuel was found to be favourable for acetol and solketal production. Simulating three production scenarios with MCNP models for preferential solketal production found that a spent fuel facility consisting of~ 1710 elements showed the largest production capacity at 57.4±5.6 t year− 1 due to the high volume available to be irradiated. Extrapolating to a theoretical European production network involving~ 180 equivalent SFP facilities based on relative reactor power, a total of (1.3±0.1)× 10 4 t year− 1 of solketal could be produced, contributing to (2.5±0.2)× 10 8 litres year− 1 to a (95% petroleum, 5% solketal) fuel blend. While this represents only~ 0.3% of total transport fuels consumed within the EU, it presents a pioneering process that could be feasible if G-values and mass productivities were improved upon."

One of the latest technology in the field of radiology is Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), which is a diagnostic tool that uses a powerful magnetic field in the process of making the radiological picture. Large magnetic field has the potential hazards that must be managed properly, to prevent accidents in the process of MRI examinations. This study aimed to get an overview of the implementation of safety manajamen on MRI services at the hospital's radiology unit in Indonesia, so we can formulate a recommendation for compliance with safety standards in accordance with the guidelines MRI safety practice. This study used a qualitative approach through observation, review of documents and interviews, which consists of pilot interviews and the depth interview. From the results of this study found that MRI safety management of hospital services in Indonesia has not been referred to the safety guidelines and risk reduction strategy is based on the danger owned facilities and infrastructure. By maximizing the supervision of staff in carrying out the strategy prepared by management, the implementation of the strategy can be done well by all the staff involved, thereby increasing the performance of radiology unit. Quality radiology service, is a service that can provide assurance of safety for patients, staff and the environment."

Especially with interventional imaging, the absence of ionizing radiation is an advantage not only for the patient, but even more so for the operator. However, MR imaging is not free from hazards. In the case of inadvertence, substantial damage is possible. The strong static magnetic field, the radiofrequency field, and the switched gradient fields have different physical effects and thus different risks emerge. Owing to the specific requirements for interventional procedures, the significant danger from ferromagnetic objects that are brought into the range of the static field and can be drawn towards the scanner with considerable force is even larger than in standard imaging. Depending on the specific environment, strict safety precautions, which address all potential hazards in all possible situations, must be implemented and personnel must be trained specifically for interventions at or near an MR scanner."

A baseline risk for malformation of 1–3% is commonly used as a reference frame for evaluating the teratogenic risk of environmental exposures. Environmental factors that have a teratogenic potential include drugs, chemicals, infections, and physical factors such as ionizing radiation. Most environmental agents were not found to have teratogenic potential, and among the drugs that were proven to be teratogenic only few, such as thalidomide and systemic retinoids, exhibit increased risk for malformation of above 20% when exposure occurred in the sensitive period. Despite the fact that only a handful of drugs and other exposures have proven to be teratogenic, women, and in many cases health providers as well, tend to overestimate teratogenic risk. In many cases, overestimation of risk may cause women to discontinue essential medications or alternatively to terminate wanted pregnancies. Ultrasound can detect a large number of structural anomalies, including many of those reported to be secondary to exposure to potentially teratogenic agents. Therefore, teratogen risk counseling needs to promote evidence-based rather than fear-based decision-making."

    "abstract": "One of the prominent features of contemporary society is an increased anxiety over risks. The potentially adverse effects of industrial development and technological innovation are the subject of widespread social concern, leading to a surge in the number of ‘risk disputes’ that involve novel technologies and projected environmental catastrophes. 1 These ‘risk disputes’ are taking place against a diverse institutional background, involving multiple voices and a plethora of discourses, which reflects a continuing struggle over epistemic authority and the control of the policy-making process. 2 Policy-makers find themselves perplexed about how best to balance the multiple voices and logics involved in these diverse ‘risk disputes’. The policy dilemma is exacerbated by the deep scientific uncertainty underlying the disputes. A particular point of tension is the interaction between experts (specifically scientific experts) and lay citizens. Regulators, at both the national and transnational levels, rely on the epistemic"

In addition, students were challenged to investigate whether flies reared on a diet containing a variety of additives display a higher number of invasive tumors in the larval abdomen.\nThe goal of the exercise was to (i) familiarize students with the multigenic origin of the cancer phenotype, to (ii) introduce some of the fundamental molecular cancer hallmarks, and to (iii) highlight the significance of invertebrate model systems in biomedical research. Furthermore, (iv) students learn to execute a molecular test for transgenic produce and (v) apply statistical tools to test a simple hypothesis.\nWe evaluated student learning and changes in opinions and attitudes relating to environmental versus genetic causes of cancer and several common misconceptions using a questionnaire before and after completing the exercise.\nOverall, significant improvements in the rate of factually correct responses and reductions in uncertainty were demonstrated. Although resistance to change was apparent in regard to identifying some risk factors, there was clear learning and understanding of the core concepts of carcinogenesis and the utility of basic research with model organisms."

The study involved 619 students from six different university departments. Data collection was performed using a closed-ended questionnaire. The general conclusion of the research was that students have incomplete knowledge about the electromagnetic radiation emitted by mobile phones and wireless networks, while at the same time they have a negative attitude and consider it dangerous to the health of living organisms. However, their behaviors regarding the protection of their health do not match with the attitudes they have formed, while in the majority they are significantly related to the university department in which they study."

In an online consumer panel (n = 245), we tested the effects of providing people with information about EMF on lay understanding of exposure, and on perceptions and responses to risks, using an experimental 2 × 2 × 2 design. Providing people with specific information explaining the distance–exposure relationship, clarifying EMF policy, or specifying personal exposure management options actions resulted in a better understanding of exposure. We demonstrated that information provision as such had no effects on concerns about EMF nor on perceived risk of personal sources, i.e. mobile phones, but lowered perception of risk of public sources, i.e. mobile phone base stations and high-voltage power lines. In addition, information explaining the distance–exposure relationship in combination with policy information resulted in reduced self-reported risk-aversive responses. Moreover, participants who understood more about exposure in relation to the distance to the source showed lower perceptions of risk, were less likely to restrict their own exposure, and more likely to accept new installations of public sources of EMF in their neighborhood. In contrast, awareness that exposure was mainly determined by personal use of EMF sources corresponded with higher perceptions of risk from personal sources and a higher likelihood to restrict one’s own exposure. Our findings provide focal points for improving communication on EMF. In particular, we suggest to include information clarifying the distance–exposure relationship to improve understanding of exposure."

    "abstract": "The potential carcinogenicity of many environmental agents (be they physical, chemical or infectious), the discovery of paediatric cancer clusters and the theory that there is a causal link between these clusters and the environment, have given rise to considerable concern among both parents and professionals. As a result, the latter are increasingly exerting their right, as citizens, to demand clear and understandable information on research and scientific findings. The only way to raise public confidence in the skills and credibility of the different people involved in these issues is to improve the educational methods employed; information must be based on the findings of multidisciplinary and pluralist expert committees, tasked with defining the research required with the help of civil society representatives. Hence, setting up an independent dialogue between different disciplines prior to studying a real or potential problem is essential to effectively informing the general public and, if necessary, explaining any uncertainties or subtleties. This approach removes any doubts as to the validity of the information provided. Excessive precaution could generate concern without providing enough information, and could therefore perpetuate public distrust and the feeling that public understanding of research is treated with disregard. Given the uncertainty regarding the health repercussions - and notably the risk of cancer potentially associated with ionising radiations, high-voltage power lines, electromagnetic fields, pollution, infections, etc. - it is essential that we carry out multidisciplinary and pluralist studies and that we supply objective information. This information should not attempt to conceal any contradictions, and should be updated regularly. Research into gene-environment interactions should provide a clearer understanding of the role of environmental factors, and of predisposed genetic vulnerability to such factors. Is there a link between nuclear power plant and the risk of leukaemia in children? There is no official answer to this question, barring that exposure to high doses or to high dose rates increases the risk. Many other genetic and environmental causes must also be taken into consideration, in order to prevent any misunderstanding. The molecular heterogeneity of leukaemia must also be taken into account when interpreting the data. Despite this complexity, the general public needs objective, comprehensible information. Scientists are under the obligation to meet the legitimate expectations of a society that is not only fully aware of its 'right to know', but is also eager for greater humanity and trust. For the reasons listed above, an independent, pluralist, technical working group composed of French and foreign experts with complementary skills and interests was created with the following mandate: - Issue an opinion on the available epidemiological knowledge of the effects of nuclear power plant (NPP), focusing in particular on the risk of childhood leukaemia; - Define the research needed to improve the existing data; - Help to deliver clear, transparent and regular information to the general public.; - Draw up guidelines for improving the existing knowledge on the link between childhood leukaemia and nuclear power plant (especially the impact of very low doses of ionising radiations). These guidelines will be made public. - Present the progress of this work to a national committee tasked with planning and monitoring the measures needed to improve the available knowledge of the effects of discharge from the nuclear industry on the health of people living nearby."

The exposome, therefore, complements the genome by providing a comprehensive description of lifelong exposure history. Remaining focused on the element of application (to epidemiology) is a key to ensuring that the exposome is translated from concept to utility for better delineating the causes and prevention of human disease.\nAt the time of the original proposal, it was recognized that whereas exquisite tools had been developed to sequence the human genome and to interrogate individual susceptibility through genome-wide association studies (GWAS), there was a relative paucity of comparable tools, or indeed investment, in relation to exposure assessment. Given that cancer and other chronic diseases develop predominantly from a combination of environmental exposures played out on a particular genetic background, the inability to measure one part of the gene: environment combination with anything approaching the precision of the other will stymie progress. This becomes particularly acute as epidemiology aims to tease out relatively modest effect sizes associated with specific environmental exposures."

Uncertain risks are discussed based on the case of electromagnetic waves, whose risks are not well known but have been largely publicized.

This Chapter focusses on the assessment of chemical, biological, ecological and radiation risks, the safety of food and feed derived from genetically modifies plants, and on the safety assessment of nuclear power plant. The aim is to introduce the basic methodological issues and problems of risk assessment through the example provided by the methods applied in a range of sectors which are of particular interest for the EU regulatory action. The basic paradigm of risk assessment includes the identification and characterisation of the hazards, the assessment of the exposure to the relevant stressors, the characterisation of the risk integrating the information on the two dimensions of risk: the hazard and the exposure. Risk assessment methods try to quantify the risk, but in many cases only a qualitative expression is possible. Risk assessment is often affected by uncertainty and variability. Probabilistic methods have been developed to address and represent uncertainty. Several aspects of risk assessment are characterised by a certain degree of subjectivity, notably when evidence and data are weighed, defaults are selected, assumptions are made based on professional judgment and expert opinion elicitation or subjective probabilities are assigned. Transparency on such aspects is key for the credibility of the assessment process. Close collaboration between assessors and managers is needed in order to frame the assessment within a risk assessment policy setting criteria and guidance for the value-laden or subjective aspects of the process as well as for the functioning of the interface between assessment and management."

Methods: An initial query was made on PubMed:“Diagnostic radiography in pregnancy AND radiation”, with the limits “published from January 1 st 1993 to December 31 st 2013, in English or Portuguese”. The articles that presented our aim were analyzed according to their MESH terms and created the final query:“((radiation) AND pregnancy) AND diagnostic imaging”. Research on April 15th of 2014, with the same limits, on PubMed gathered 688 articles; on SCOPUS 245 additional articles. After reading the title and abstract 298 articles remained. 179 allowed access to full text and were analyzed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 103 articles were used and an additional one regarding In uteroradiation exposure from atomic bombs. The PRISMA statement was followed. Results: Deterministic effects like pregnancy loss, congenital malformations, growth retardation and neurobehavioral abnormalities have threshold doses greater 100-200 mGy, being the risk considered negligible at 50 mGy. No diagnostic exam exceeds this limit. The most crucial time to avoid radiation exposure is from the 8 th to the 15 th week of gestation. The risk of carcinogenesis is slightly higher than the general population, although very similar. Intravenous contrast is discouraged, except in highly-selected patients. Conclusion: Measures to diminish radiation are essential and affect the fetal outcome. Nonionizing procedures should be considered whenever possible and every radiology center should have its own data on fetal radiation exposure."

    "abstract": "BACKGROUND\nThe use of non-invasive cardiovascular imaging tests for diagnosing coronary artery disease (CAD) has risen dramatically over the last decade. However, guidelines for the diagnosis and management of patients with stable ischemic heart disease reported a lack of attention devoted to users' satisfaction, and repeatedly documented the importance of patient-oriented research to guide clinical decision-making. In this context, this study aims to contribute to the understanding of patient and physician preference in relation to the choice of cardiovascular imaging tests.\nMETHODS\nA discrete choice experiment (DCE) questionnaire on a convenience sample from the Royal Victoria cardiology clinic was used to systematically elicit patient and physician preference toward diagnostic imaging tests. Tests were differentiated using 6 attributes (patient out-of-pocket cost, risks and side effects, type of procedures, diagnostic accuracy, type of scanner and test duration). A choice-based conjoint analysis with hierarchical Bayes estimation was performed with Sawtooth Software.\nRESULTS\nOne hundred and forty-eight cardiac patients and 63 physicians completed the DCE. Risks and side effects had the highest impact on patients' preference (30%). Patients assigned notably high utility to tests with milder side effects (+ 97.7), while avoiding exposure to ionizing radiation (-36.7) and risks associated with exercise and the use of pharmacological agents inducing direct coronary arteriolar vasodilation (-61.0). Physicians attributed more importance to costs for patients (29%).\nCONCLUSIONS\nPatients' preference was most determined by the risks and side effects associated with cardiovascular imaging tests, while physicians preferred less costly alternatives. When engaging in shared decision-making with patients, physicians should discuss the risks and side effects associated with cardiovascular imaging tests. In aiming for the best possible care, the clinical implementation of safer, more accurate and cost-effective imaging tests for diagnosing CAD may improve users' satisfaction and health outcomes."

To reach and penetrate the oocyte, spermatozoa should possess progressive motility. Therefore, motility is an important parameter during both natural and assisted conception. The global trend of progressive reduction in the number and motility of healthy spermatozoa in the ejaculate is associated with increased risk of infertility. Therefore, developing approaches for maintaining or enhancing human sperm motility has been an important area of investigation. In this review we discuss the physiology of sperm, molecular pathways regulating sperm motility, risk factors affecting sperm motility, and the role of sperm motility in fertility outcomes. In addition, we discuss various pharmacological agents and biomolecules that can enhance sperm motility in vitro and in vivo conditions to improve assisted reproductive technology (ART) outcomes. This article opens dialogs to help toxicologists, clinicians, andrologists, and embryologists in understanding the mechanism of factors influencing sperm motility and various management strategies to improve treatment outcomes."

Audiovisual media (movies and series) can be used to provide context, and it can help overcome many students’ negative attitudes toward real science. An example of audiovisual media in which a science context can be presented is science fiction (abbreviated Sci-Fi). The purpose of this study was to investigate how the Sci-Fi context influences pre-service teachers’ attitudes and perceptions regarding the use of Sci-Fi for teaching and learning science, with a focus on chemistry, as a result of a 15-week novel elective Sci-Fi course for pre-service teachers. The main instruments used were online questionnaires, a final exam, and a rubric-based presentation evaluation form. The results of our study show that the majority of pre-service teachers consider the Sci-Fi context to be a very interesting context for science education, especially chemistry, and a useful tool for promoting students’ interest in science. Students believe that it is important to incorporate the Sci-Fi context into chemistry instruction at all levels. Our results suggest that the Sci-Fi context is useful to students as an alternative learning method that can be used to improve student learning outcomes."

    "abstract": "Since the beginning of the twenty first century electricity has become an integral part of every human‟s life. Without electricity some of the human activities on planet earth would have never been brought into existence and some of them will not be possible (Fews, 1999). Electricity is supplied to old and current technology apparatus such as computers, different types of machinery, laboratory and medical devices, household appliances, automobiles, and treatment plant equipment. Electricity moves from power generation plants (power stations) in a form of high voltage to urban and rural electrical substations where it will be converted into low voltage to suit residential electrical processes (Ilonen, 2008). According to Kaune (1993), high voltage electricity moves through overhead and underground power lines and it is converted into low voltage once it reaches electrical distribution substations in the residential areas. Furthermore, electrical substations serve many functions, such as controlling, collecting and transferring power on electrical systems (Kaune, 1993). Along the transportation and conversion of voltages, the two invisible fields known as magnetic and electric fields are produced (Kovetz, 2000). Both magnetic and electric fields are produced by movement of charged and stationary electrical particles as described in the Maxwell‟s equation (Lee, 1996). These fields are expressed in hertz (Hz) and can be classified as very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), extremely low frequency (ELF) and high frequency fields (HFF) (Brent, 1999). Extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields are fields with frequency that ranges between 3 to 3000 Hz and they are usually formed when the electrical current flows (World Health Organisation, 2007). According to Sinatra (2002), once there is higher current flow during conversion or transmission, high voltages are produced as a result of increased magnetic field flux. High voltages are mainly used when transferring power over long distances from generation plants to final distribution substations (Portier and Wolfe, 1998). When electricity is being transferred and has reached distribution substations, the intensity of the electric and magnetic fields changes. Lacy-Hulbert, Metcalfe and Hesketh (1998) indicated that an intensity of electric fields created is determined by the amount of voltages transferred and the flow of current determines the magnitude of magnetic fields that will be produced. The force of both magnetic and electric fields is induced by different substation devices which include wirings, cables and installations. According to the National Institute for Environmental Health (NIEH) (2002), most substations use alternating current (AC) in distributing and converting current, which produces magnetic and electric fields at various magnitude levels. The level of exposure to magnetic fields is determined by the distance between the source and the receiver (Portier and Wolfe, 1998). According to Loomis and Savitz (1995), individuals in close proximity to distribution substations are more likely to be exposed to high levels of magnetic fields than those residing far from them. Individuals exposed to magnetic fields are likely to develop detrimental health effects, such as childhood leukaemia. However there is still controversy on this matter (Draper, 2005)."

Results suggest that individuals who initially perceived greater benefits from their cell phone showed less change in perceived risk after reading the precautionary message. Perceived risk also had a significant positive relationship with intentions to engage in protective behaviors.

It is not easy to identify the honest researchers, picking them out from among the violators and profiteers, whose main aims are promoting career and business. It is much simpler to actually carry out good research and identify any studies that are flawed or biased. This is, of course, a true researcher’s main goal.\nIndeed, best practice in both environmental and occupational epidemiology has been well established for years (Hernberg 1981). However, the correct use of these methods is not routinely applied, a failure regrettably borne out by numerous studies on exposed workers (eg, in oil refineries, petrochemical or steel plants), military personnel (eg, exposure to depleted uranium) and people living in areas suffering from pollution (eg, due to the presence of industrial plants and urban traffic congestion). Moreover, the findings of studies carried out with the benefit of corporate funding often conclude that a population exposed to some occupational or environmental risk factor, or to treatment with this or that drug, is healthier than the control population (though only until truly independent studies are carried out, these often uncovering very different results). An article published quite recently highlighted this common failure, and proposed how it might be corrected, pointing out 15 errors and biases, and so enabling epidemiologists to avoid the most serious diagnostic error that can be made: reporting a sick population as healthy (Gennaro and Tomatis 2005). 2 This serious under-estimation of the epidemiological risk of disease can be produced in good or bad faith. The latter–termed business bias in occupational and environmental epidemiology–can be understood as an intentional study bias, specifically set up to prioritize both economic and career-related ambitions over scientific research, whose legitimate goal should be the minimization of"

In recent years, gold nanoparticles (GNP) have been explored for their potential as an enhancer of external beam radiation and become the standard-bearer for the treatment modality; however, GNP have lower cellular uptake in anoxic and hypoxic conditions than under normoxic conditions. Additionally, the large size of nanoparticles decreases their diffusivity, reducing their ability to penetrate into tumor tissue distant from vasculature."

    "abstract": "The space environment is very constraining for satellite systems, which are exposed to intense fluxes of radiation that can potentially generate a number of degradations. Electronic systems are particularly sensitive to radiation effects. Taking into account these effects requires efficient radiation transport codes (Monte Carlo method). Modeling the transport of electrons down to a few eV is required to study some phenomena that could arise in electronic components. But the electron transport models are most of time valid only down to hundred of eV. The aim of the thesis is to develop an electron transportation code valid down to a few eV for dielectric materials of interest in the space domain (SiO2, HfO2, Al2O3, Au, Cu, Ag2S, BN, Ag2O …), in a joint effort between CNES, ONERA and CEA, in order to to studythe effect of the internal charge on the electron emission (TEEY), which is responsible of several issues in space electronics.We have first extended the MicroElec module to the transportation of low energy electrons, protons, and ions in 16 materials. The transport of electrons can be simulated down to the eV, and the models are publicly released in Geant4. We have also developed an analytical model for secondary electron emission, which follows a physically consistant approach.We have notably developed of a Monte-Carlo model able to simulate the effect of positive internal charging on the TEEY of insulating materials, with a focus on SiO2 thin films due to the wide availability of reference data on this material.We have gathered a significant amount of knowledge on the effects of charging onthe TEEY of SiO2 thin films, by conducting experimental measurements and using our model to explain them. It was first demonstrated that the reduction of the TEEY, observed experimentally and in the simulations, is due to the recombination of the secondary electrons with the holes. From this knowledge, we have shown that the presence of residual holes in the sample at the start of a measurement could cause some significant errors in the TEEY, and proposed a discharging method usable during TEEY characterization campaigns. The origin of the multiple humps in the energy/TEEY curves was explained by showing the effect of current density. Lastly, we have explained the effect of temperature on the TEEY by the thermally activated hopping transport. This demonstrates the necessity for new TEEY measurement standards that are specific to dielectrics."

The exchange students were from overseas universities affiliated with Konan University, located in Kobe Japan. 75 of them took my class (International Education and Japan) between 2009 and 2012 as one of the Japan Studies courses. This course has consistently focused on the legacy of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a point of departure for a peaceful world in the 21st century. Most of these students already had personal views regarding the use of atomic bombs in 1945 which were strongly influenced by their own history education in their home countries. However, through the study of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as a process of international education for peace in class, along with field trips in Hiroshima, especially Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum, I have found some visible transformation in their attitudes towards the issues of atomic bombs, as reflected in their final research papers. Although the number of respondents is limited, the results of this study indicate the contemporary significance of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for Western students. Despite the fact that some of them have subconsciously been influenced strongly by Orientalism, the Western-centered conception of Japan in Said’s context, I believe it is my mission as a Japanese professor of international education to involve our exchange students in the discussion of some of the most tragic events in human history including the atrocities of Japanese soldiers in order to cultivate a peaceful sense of humanity in their hearts. Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the recent tragedy of the Fukushima nuclear power plants, which melted down following the aftermath of the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, still have universal implications for sustainable human survival. We are still learning from history that we have not yet learned enough from our own human history."

    "abstract": "One important reason for male infertility is oxidative stress and its destructive effects on sperm structures and functions. The particular composition of the sperm membrane, rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids, and the easy access of sperm DNA to oxidative damage due to sperm cell specific cytologic and metabolic features (no cytoplasm left and cells unable to mount stress responses) make it the cell type in metazoans most susceptible to oxidative damage. In particular, oxidative damage to the spermatozoa genome is an important issue and a cause of male infertility, usually associated with single- or double-strand paternal DNA breaks. Various methods of detecting sperm DNA fragmentation have become important diagnostic tools in the prognosis of male infertility and such assays are available in research laboratories and andrology clinics. However, to date, there is not a clear consensus in the community as to their respective prognostic value. Nevertheless, it is important to understand that the effects of oxidative stress on the sperm genome go well beyond DNA fragmentation alone. Oxidation of paternal DNA bases, particularly guanine and adenosine residues, the most sensitive residues to oxidative alteration, is the starting point for DNA damage in spermatozoa but is also a danger for the integrity of the embryo genetic material independently of sperm DNA fragmentation. Due to the lack of a spermatozoa DNA repair system and, if the egg is unable to correct the sperm oxidized bases, the risk of de novo mutation transmission to the embryo exists. These will be carried on to every cell of the future individual and its progeny. Thus, in addition to affecting the viability of the pregnancy itself, oxidation of the DNA bases in sperm could be associated with the development of conditions in young and future adults. Despite these important issues, sperm DNA base oxidation has not attracted much interest among clinicians due to the lack of simple, reliable, rapid and consensual methods of assessing this type of damage to the paternal genome. In addition to these technical issues, another reason explaining why the measurement of sperm DNA oxidation is not included in male fertility is likely to be due to the lack of strong evidence for its role in pregnancy outcome. It is, however, becoming clear that the assessment of DNA base oxidation could improve the efficiency of assisted reproductive technologies and provide important information on embryonic developmental failures and pathologies encountered in the offspring. The objective of this work is to review relevant research that has been carried out in the field of sperm DNA base oxidation and its associated genetic and epigenetic consequences."

    "abstract": "This article brings together the perspectives issued over the last decade on the concept of Risk Communication in the concrete case of risks related to a recent and fast-developing technology: mobile telephony and electromagnetic fields associated with it. We reviewed a specific corpus of scientific articles and identified two dominant approaches on Risk Communication: an Expert Model Approach and a Lay Model Approach. The majority of the scholars underline the unequal distribution of roles to the actors involved in the communicative processes and sustain the necessity of finding a common frame for dialogue, thus advocating for a third possible approach, based on the “democratisation of risk” as a way of accommodating the technocratic vision of the expert model with the negotiated vision of the lay model."

This study explores the perspectives of local citizens affected by a proposed HVOTL to connect new nuclear power at Hinkley Point in Southwest England. A two-day public workshop was held with 38 participants in an affected line-site community, using deliberative focus group methods to explore perceptions of environmental and social impacts, risks, governance arrangements and technology choices. The findings show how potential health effects from electric and magnetic fields (EMF) and visual impacts are perceived to industrialise rural places, disrupt place attachments and provoke local opposition. The findings challenge the ‘not-in-my-back-yard’ assumption that citizens are selfish place-protectionists that lack the technical sophistication necessary to take a strategic viewpoint on transmission system development. They also reveal how decision making under the former UK Infrastructure Planning Commission's (IPC) (and its successor body the Planning Inspectorate) presents a challenge to procedural justice, as front-loaded developer-led consultation practices curtail citizen input to key decisions on alternative technologies (for example, underground or undersea lines). This is likely to exacerbate public mistrust of transmission system operators and provoke further organised protest."

Despite significant breakthroughs in medical technologies, advanced treatments and research efforts to combat cancer, burden of cancer remains devastating on human life.\nRecent advancements in medical science and health care technologies, and development of innovative medical instruments proved to enhance cancer treatment; however, there is still no substantial slowdown in mortality rate and treatment costs. The significant socio-economic impact of cancer and shortfalls of currently available conventional treatment methods motivate scientists and engineers to scavenge for novel cost-effective cancer treatment approaches with less severe side-effects and enhanced efficacy."

In the Internet Model of the Theory of Everything (iTOE), the TOE is proposed as a new discipline of study for developing Fundamental Theory (Standard Model) for any field/discipline. The iTOE Model simply states that Consciousness-Energy (CEN) is everything that really exists, meaning all things (whether living or non-living), including all fields and disciplines, are all manifestations (states or forms) of a single entity/matrix: Consciousness-Energy (CEN). The iTOE uses a set of interdisciplinary, intradisciplinary, transdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and crossdisciplinary approaches to building the TOE in Consciousness Science and is the first of its kind in existence. It is a network theory—a new approach to the TOE, which entails internetworking and interconnecting all fields and disciplines modelled as networks or webs using CEN. The TOE is built based on Eight Axioms, the Axioms of Everything (AxioE), as its core, with a new algebra, Temic algebra, the Algebra of Everything (AlgebroE), and new numbers, Temic numbers, the Numbers for Everything (NumoE), harmonizing, unifying, and standardizing all fields and disciplines using CEN as the Universal Language—the Language for Everything (LoE). The Model has potential applications across all spheres of life and will spur new technologies and breakthroughs in all fields and disciplines."

    "abstract": "Several centuries ago in England, the black swan was a popular symbol for the impossible because no such creature had ever been seen. Then came the surprise: Black swans were discovered in Australia. Since then, the bird has symbolized that which seems impossible but can in fact occur. The black swan reminds us that believing something cannot happen is often just a failure of imagination. Parts of society today hold the same view of nuclear war that society in England did of black swans centuries ago: No nuclear war has ever been observed, so it may seem impossible that one would occur. Though nations possess some 16,000 nuclear warheads, deterrence just seems to work. And so, especially with the Cold War a fading memory, attention has shifted elsewhere. But it is just as much of a mistake to think that nuclear war couldn ‘t happen now as it was to think that black swans couldn ‘t exist back then.\nIt is true that, in any given year, nuclear war is unlikely, but the chance of it happening is not zero. Stanford professor emeritus Martin Hellman has a great way of explaining the risk. He compares it to a coin of unknown bias, flipped once a year for every year since the first Soviet nuclear weapon test in 1949. For 65 years, the coin has always landed on heads. If the coin had always landed flat on heads, we might think the probability of tails was close to zero. But in some years, the coin has teetered on its edge before falling on heads. Given this, should we still think the probability is near zero?"

    "abstract": "Humankind has made stories about the origin of the Universe since prehistoric times, but it is only in the last hundred years that such myths and images have been replaced by a well-established scientific description of the origin and evolution of the Universe. The development of modern cosmology is with no doubt one of the scientific triumphs of the twentieth century, culminated in the establishment of the Standard Cosmological Model, representing an almost universal consensus amongst scientists as to the best description of our Universe. According to this model, the Universe started out in an extremely hot and dense state called the\" Big Bang\" about 13.8 billion years ago and continued expanding since then. The Standard Model is remarkably successful and supported by numerous astronomical evidences; however, ongoing mysteries such as the cause of the current accelerated expansion of the Universe and the true nature of dark matter make it clear that we have some way to go before we can say that a full picture of the physics of the Universe is complete. The most important observation supporting the Standard Cosmological Model is the existence of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation, heat radiation released when the Universe was just few hundreds of thousands years old. From its discovery in the 1960s, more and more accurate observations of the CMB has followed, providing us invaluable information about the early history of the Universe obtainable in no other way.\nThe current frontier in the study of the Cosmic Microwave Background is the measurement of its polarization anisotropies. Indeed, the curl-like component of the CMB polarization field (also known as\" B-modes\") is thought to be holding the imprint of primordial gravitational waves, whose presence is predicted by the Inflationary paradigm. This theory accounts for the accelerated expansion of the Universe that is believed to have happened"

    "abstract": "A typical proton CT (pCT) detector comprises a tracking system, used to measure the proton position before and after the imaged object, and an energy/range detector to measure the residual proton range after crossing the object. The Bergen pCT collaboration was established to design and build a prototype pCT scanner with a high granularity digital tracking calorimeter used as both tracking and energy/range detector. In this work the conceptual design and the layout of the mechanical and electronics implementation, along with Monte Carlo simulations of the new pCT system are reported. The digital tracking calorimeter is a multilayer structure with a lateral aperture of 27 cm × 16.6 cm, made of 41 detector/absorber sandwich layers (calorimeter), with aluminum (3.5 mm) used both as absorber and carrier, and two additional layers used as tracking system (rear trackers) positioned downstream of the imaged object; no tracking upstream the object is included. The rear tracker’s structure only differs from the calorimeter layers for the carrier made of ∼200 μm carbon fleece and carbon paper (carbon-epoxy sandwich), to minimize scattering. Each sensitive layer consists of 108 ALICE pixel detector (ALPIDE) chip sensors (developed for ALICE, CERN) bonded on a polyimide flex and subsequently bonded to a larger flexible printed circuit board. Beam tests tailored to the pCT operation have been performed using high-energetic (50–220 MeV/u) proton and ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) in Germany. These tests proved the ALPIDE response independent of occupancy and proportional to the particle energy deposition, making the distinction of different ion tracks possible. The read-out electronics is able to handle enough data to acquire a single 2D image in few seconds making the system fast enough to be used in a clinical environment. For the reconstructed images in the modeled Monte Carlo simulation, the water equivalent path length error is lower than 2 mm, and the relative stopping power accuracy is better than 0.4%. Thanks to its ability to detect different types of radiation and its specific design, the pCT scanner can be employed for additional online applications during the treatment, such as in-situ proton range verification."

Methods: An initial query was made on PubMed:“Diagnostic radiography in pregnancy AND radiation”, with the limits “published from January 1 st 1993 to December 31 st 2013, in English or Portuguese”. The articles that presented our aim were analyzed according to their MESH terms and created the final query:“((radiation) AND pregnancy) AND diagnostic imaging”. Research on April 15th of 2014, with the same limits, on PubMed gathered 688 articles; on SCOPUS 245 additional articles. After reading the title and abstract 298 articles remained. 179 allowed access to full text and were analyzed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 103 articles were used and an additional one regarding In uteroradiation exposure from atomic bombs. The PRISMA statement was followed. Results: Deterministic effects like pregnancy loss, congenital malformations, growth retardation and neurobehavioral abnormalities have threshold doses greater 100-200 mGy, being the risk considered negligible at 50 mGy. No diagnostic exam exceeds this limit. The most crucial time to avoid radiation exposure is from the 8 th to the 15 th week of gestation. The risk of carcinogenesis is slightly higher than the general population, although very similar. Intravenous contrast is discouraged, except in highly-selected patients. Conclusion: Measures to diminish radiation are essential and affect the fetal outcome. Nonionizing procedures should be considered whenever possible and every radiology center should have its own data on fetal radiation exposure."

The learning module defeating cancer includes two main parts, one on cancer therapy and the second on drug development. The first part of Chap. 1 provides an introduction to the major problems we face when we treat malignant tumors in humans, setting the stage for Chap. 2 with a systematic overview over the current options of cancer therapy such as surgery, radiation, immunotherapy and chemotherapy and their corresponding modes of action. In particular, we focus on standard chemotherapeutic and targeted drugs and explain how they work. In Chap. 3, we cover intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms which represent the main obstacle to improve the clinical outcome of current cancer therapies. Chapter 4 is dedicated to the discovery and development of novel anticancer drugs. The development of new medicines to treat cancer nowadays is based on our growing understanding of the disease. In order to understand this paradigm shift, we discuss how medicines have been discovered and developed in the past. The structure of Chap. 2 reflects the development process of a new drug beginning with the identification and validation of a therapeutic target, the identification of an inhibitor of the target and its subsequent preclinical and clinical development. Finally, we describe the approval process by regulatory authorities. Chapter 5 provides a critical examination of the economic aspects of our current system of developing new medicines and its impact on our societies and on future drug research. At the end of each chapter, a section with thought questions and further reading has been added."

    "abstract": "Male reproductive health is governed by an intricate interplay of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Epigenetic mechanisms—encompassing DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNA activity—are crucial both for spermatogenesis and sperm maturation. However, oxidative stress, driven by excessive reactive oxygen species, disrupts these processes, leading to impaired sperm function and male infertility. This disruption extends to epigenetic modifications, resulting in abnormal gene expression and chromatin remodeling that compromise genomic integrity and fertilization potential. Importantly, oxidative-stress-induced epigenetic alterations can be inherited, affecting the health and fertility of offspring and future generations. This review investigates how oxidative stress influences epigenetic regulation in male reproduction by modifying DNA methylation, histone modifications, and non-coding RNAs, ultimately compromising spermatogenesis. Additionally, it discusses the transgenerational implications of these epigenetic disruptions and their potential role in hereditary infertility and disease predisposition. Understanding these mechanisms is vital for developing therapeutic strategies that mitigate oxidative damage and restore epigenetic homeostasis in the male germline. By integrating insights from molecular, clinical, and transgenerational research, this work emphasizes the need for targeted interventions to enhance male reproductive health and prevent adverse outcomes in progeny. Furthermore, elucidating the dose–response relationships between oxidative stress and epigenetic changes remains a critical research priority, informing personalized diagnostics and therapeutic interventions. In this context, future studies should adopt standardized markers of oxidative damage, robust clinical trials, and multi-omic approaches to capture the complexity of epigenetic regulation in spermatogenesis. Such rigorous investigations will ultimately reduce the risk of transgenerational disorders and optimize reproductive health outcomes."

    "abstract": "For thousands of years, curious people have been asking themselves simple questions about the nature of things: what are we made of, what is our universe made of? Those questions brought the scientific community to take interest in increasingly smaller objects in a quest to unravel the nature of the elementary building blocks of matter. Following the intuition of ancient greek philosophers on these ατoµoς (atomos, unbreakable) objects, chemists in the 19th century were the firsts to rigorously classify the simplest components of matter known at that time [1]. They made the distinction between complex chemical compounds and simple elements which Dmitri Mendeleev classified in his famous table in 1869 [2]. However it was soon realized that the atom, despite its name, was not truly elementary. In 1897, physicist Joseph Thomson interpreted his experimental results on cathode rays as evidence for the existence of an electrically charged subatomic particle: the electron [3]. This was followed by his proposal of the commonly called Plum Pudding model for the structure of the atom, in 1904 [4]. In this model, a positively charged volume is filled with negatively charged electrons. Ernest Rutherford, directing the work of Geiger and Marsden, proved Thomson wrong in a paper published in 1911 [5] where he presented the results of a scattering experiment. Using α and β rays from radioactive sources, he proved that all the positive charge of the atom is actually located in a very small central region. This led to the discovery of the atomic nucleus and the development of the Rutherford–Bohr atomic model in 1913 [6]. In 1919, Rutherford demonstrated that the positive charge inside the nucleus was made of Hydrogen nuclei which he later named protons [7]. James Chadwick completed this work by discovering in 1932 the other nuclear subcomponent, the neutron [8].\nFrom this series of events, it seems that the study of the elementary components of matter has been following two paths, closely intertwined. The first one is the continuous change of paradigm regarding the understanding of what matter is and how it behaves. It implies to develop models that describe new realities with the mathematical tools at hand. On this road, one of the most important milestones is probably Max Planck’s 1900 hypothesis that the electromagnetic energy emitted from a black body in thermal equilibrium is quantized [9]. In his 1905 paper on the photoelectric effect [10], Albert Einstein showed that these quanta of energy are to be understood as particles of light (lichtquanta) that were later renamed photons. These ideas layed the foundations of a radically different conception of matter based on quantized energy states: quantum mechanics. The quantum theory rules the microscopic world at the scale of the molecules and smaller and has proven to give outstanding results. The year 1905 was quite productive for Einstein as he also presented a new theory of electrodynamics in a moving referential [11]. His theory of special relativity corrected Galileo’s approach that collapses at very high velocities, close to the speed of light c. Soon enough, physicists such as Oskar Klein, Walter Gordon and Paul Dirac attempted to come up with an equation that could describe the behaviour of microscopic fast moving object, ie a quantum and relativistic equation. The Klein-Gordon equation was presented in 1926 [12, 13] followed in 1928 by the Dirac equation [14]. This is the beginning of Quantum Field Theory (QFT), a theory suited for the characterization of microscopic objects at high kinetic energies."

In this chapter we deal with “scientific expertise”, i.e., recommendations issued by scientists on problems that are relevant from an extra-scientific point of view. These recommendations are based on scientific knowledge, but directed at concrete problems. Expert recommendations address specific challenges and are expected to provide tailor-made proposals as to how to deal with these challenges. Scientific experts often give policy advice and draw on science for elaborating their recommendations. For instance, scientific experts decide about the efficacy of medical drugs or about the safety of tanning devices or cell phones (as the German radiation protection commission, the Strahlenschutzkommission, does). The usual self-understanding of scientific experts is that they bring scientific knowledge to bear on the particular case at hand. Expertise is often passed off as the mere tapping of the repository of knowledge or of simply applying scientific knowledge to experience."

    "abstract": "Infrared (IR) thermography is a non-ionizing and non-invasive imaging modality that allows the measurement of the spatial and temporal variations of the infrared radiation emitted by the human body. The emitted radiation and the skin surface temperature that can be derived from the emitted radiation data carry a wealth of information about different processes within the human body. To advance the quantitative use of IR thermography in medical diagnostics, this dissertation investigates several issues critical to the demands imposed by clinical applications. We developed a computational thermal model of the human skin with multiple layers and a near-surface lesion to understand the thermal behavior of skin tissue in dynamic infrared imaging. With the aid of this model, various cooling methods and conditions suitable for the clinical application of dynamic IR imaging are critically evaluated. The analysis of skin cooling provides a quantitative basis for the selection and optimization of cooling conditions in the clinical practice of dynamic IR imaging. To improve the quantitative accuracy for the analysis of dynamic IR imaging, we proposed a motion tracking approach using a template-based algorithm. The motion tracking approach is capable of following the involuntary motion of the subject in the IR image sequence, thereby allowing us to track the temperature evolution for a particular region on the skin. In addition, to compensate for the measurement artifacts induced by the surface curvature in IR thermography, a correction formula was developed based on the emissivity model and phantom experiments. The correction formula was integrated into a 3D imaging procedure based on a system combining Kinect and IR cameras. We demonstrated the feasibility of mapping 2D IR images onto the 3D surface of the human body. The accuracy of temperature measurement was improved by applying the correction method. Finally, we designed a variety of quantitative approaches to analyze the clinical data acquired from patient studies of pigmented lesions and hemangiomas. These approaches allow us to evaluate the thermal signatures of lesions with different characteristics, measured in both static and dynamic IR imaging. The collection of methodologies described in this dissertation, leading to improved ease of use and accuracy, can contribute to the broader implementation of quantitative IR thermography in medical diagnostics."

    "abstract": "On 6 April 2009, an earthquake hit the city of L’Aquila in Italy, destroying much of the historical centre, injuring thousands of people and killing more than 300. In an unprecedented verdict, in October 2012 the court of first instance in L’Aquila condemned for manslaughter the six Italian scientists, members of a national scientific advisory committee. The reasoning underpinning the verdict centres around the scientists’ poor assessment and communication of the seismic risk. Two years later, in November 2014, the Appeal Court of L’Aquila reversed the first instance verdict, acquitting the scientists. This trial is of paramount importance, being the first (criminal) trial to regulatory scientists in contemporary history. Unsurprisingly, the first instance verdict has attracted much criticism. In contrast to most commentaries harshly criticizing the verdict, we find that the first instance verdict invites broader reflection on the role and possible responsibility of scientists in risk governance. We take the L’Aquila trial as a case study and look at the general relevance of this case for a debate on accountability of regulatory science. This article defends the view that, in a world where scientists retain a certain degree of regulatory authority, they should be held accountable for their contribution to regulating risks. While we find criminal liability not necessarily the most appropriate way to establish accountability, it is equally incorrect to have no accountability at all. Drawing on the L’Aquila case, this article shows the overall desirability of a legal framework for accountability of regulatory science."

    "abstract": "For 30 years ~22,000 men were silenced by the Official Secrets Act. They participated in 21 nuclear tests conducted by the UK in Australia and the South Pacific from 1952-1958. Since 1983 these men have been campaigning for recognition following premature deaths, illness, miscarriages, and offspring deformities, to no avail. They are the British Nuclear Test Veteran (BNTV) community and in 2021, almost 70 years since the first nuclear test, less than 3,000 of them remain. This unique ageing population face a double jeopardy of invisibility: hidden by government red tape, and now marginalised as the oldest old. The discourse is dominated by the health effects of radiation and the servicemen’s lived experiences, the nuances of ageing, and any health and wellbeing issues have not been investigated. This thesis therefore had three key objectives: to understand the complexities of BNTV identity; critically explore health and wellbeing issues among the BNTV community; and analyse types of leisure activities that enhance wellbeing and reasons for engagement. Using a life history approach, this interpretivist qualitative study conducted two rounds of in-depth interviews with 29 members of the BNTV community. A systematic framework for narrative analysis led to the construction of three creative nonfiction stories representing the ‘big’, ‘small’, shared, and exceptional experiences of the BNTVs. Key findings include loneliness and loss; collective nuclear experience and identity; illness following potential exposure; and staying active to reduce the perceived side effects of ageing. By challenging the politics of ageing, health, and wellbeing, from the perspective of this diverse ageing population, this work not only impacts the community which it interviewed but also provides the foundations for future programmes of support to address the salient issues that have been identified. Furthermore, these CNF stories provide the BNTV community with the recognition they have been seeking."

    "abstract": "A typical proton CT (pCT) detector comprises a tracking system, used to measure the proton position before and after the imaged object, and an energy/range detector to measure the residual proton range after crossing the object. The Bergen pCT collaboration was established to design and build a prototype pCT scanner with a high granularity digital tracking calorimeter used as both tracking and energy/range detector. In this work the conceptual design and the layout of the mechanical and electronics implementation, along with Monte Carlo simulations of the new pCT system are reported. The digital tracking calorimeter is a multilayer structure with a lateral aperture of 27 cm × 16.6 cm, made of 41 detector/absorber sandwich layers (calorimeter), with aluminum (3.5 mm) used both as absorber and carrier, and two additional layers used as tracking system (rear trackers) positioned downstream of the imaged object; no tracking upstream the object is included. The rear tracker’s structure only differs from the calorimeter layers for the carrier made of ∼200 μm carbon fleece and carbon paper (carbon-epoxy sandwich), to minimize scattering. Each sensitive layer consists of 108 ALICE pixel detector (ALPIDE) chip sensors (developed for ALICE, CERN) bonded on a polyimide flex and subsequently bonded to a larger flexible printed circuit board. Beam tests tailored to the pCT operation have been performed using high-energetic (50–220 MeV/u) proton and ion beams at the Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) in Germany. These tests proved the ALPIDE response independent of occupancy and proportional to the particle energy deposition, making the distinction of different ion tracks possible. The read-out electronics is able to handle enough data to acquire a single 2D image in few seconds making the system fast enough to be used in a clinical environment. For the reconstructed images in the modeled Monte Carlo simulation, the water equivalent path length error is lower than 2 mm, and the relative stopping power accuracy is better than 0.4%. Thanks to its ability to detect different types of radiation and its specific design, the pCT scanner can be employed for additional online applications during the treatment, such as in-situ proton range verification."

    "abstract": "Purpose: Tort reform refers to changes to the civil justice system to reduce the ability of patients to bring civil lawsuits or to reduce the ultimate amount of damages they can receive. In an effort to curb defensive medicine costs, several states have proposed or enacted tort reform addressed specifically at non-radiologist emergency department (ED) physicians, which raise the threshold of liability to require gross negligence or even recklessness. Emergency radiologists face many of the same challenges as other ED physicians with respect to volume, acuity and limited patient histories. Additionally, comparison studies are often lacking, the turn-around times for radiology reports are shorter and much of the work is performed at night, when subspecialist consultations are unavailable. Considering the legislation to limit liability for ED clinicians, should the same protections be extended to emergency radiologists?\nMaterials and Methods: An anonymous online survey was circulated to the 407 radiologist members of the American Society of Emergency Radiology to evaluate awareness and opinions of emergency radiologists regarding the above described tort reform measures. A review of the various states’ tort reform legislation was also performed.\nResults: There were 105 responses, representing a 25.8% response rate. 90.5% of respondents were not aware that in certain states tort reform specifically addresses the ED setting and raises the legal threshold for liability for ED clinicians. 80.0% of respondents believe that similar reforms should be enacted for emergency radiologists as well.\nConclusion: Nearly half of all states have some degree of tort reform; with several specifically addressing emergency care by ED clinicians. Emergency radiologists, like ED physicians, work in a setting of high acuity and volume and are often limited by the paucity of patient histories or comparison studies. The majority of respondents believe tort reforms for ED physicians should apply similarly to radiologists who work alongside them in the ED setting. Radiologists are often instrumental in advising ED physicians regarding the appropriateness and sufficiency of imaging studies, and provide expedient reports that aid patient disposition. Their liability should be similarly reflective of the risks under which they operate."

    "abstract": "Mid-2007 Prof. Alexander Lerchl, biologist at the private Jacobs University in Bremen and member of the German Commission on Radiological Protection (SSK) of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), informs the rector of the Medical University of Vienna (MUV), Prof. Wolfgang Schütz, about a serious suspicion: the findings of research carried out at the Division of Occupational Medicine of his university and published in Mutation Research in 2005 (Diem et al.) are most likely fraudulent. Shortly thereafter, he makes the same accusation against another study from the same laboratory, which was published in the International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health (IAOEH) at the beginning of 2008 (Schwarz et al.). In spring 2008, the rector mandates the newly appointed Council for Scientific Ethics of MUV, which consists of three persons he trusts, to clarify the expressed suspicion. Without thoroughly examining the allegations, this Council confirms the accusation of data fabrication already after its first meeting on May 16, 2008. As a result, the rector demands of the authors to immediately retract their publications from Mutation Research and the International Archives. He also demands of the editors-just like Prof. Lerchl did before-to remove the publications from their scientific journals because of a suspected serious scientific fraud. A first press release by the rector and a first report in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel written by the journalist Manfred Dworschak immediately broadcast the allegedly confirmed fraud scandal to the whole world.\nHowever, a few days after the meeting of the Council for Scientific Ethics it is accidentally revealed that the rector-appointed Council chair has been a lawyer employed by the Austrian mobile phone industry. Because of suspicion of partiality, Prof. Hugo Rüdiger, the former director of the Clinical Division of Occupational Medicine and corresponding author of both publications, requests the immediate removal of this Council chair who, according to the Council‘s statutes, should never have been appointed to this position. He also withdraws the signatures he gave to letters presented to him and addressed to the editors of the two journals, in which he had declared his willingness to retract the publications. The team member accused of data fabrication follows his example. Thus, they both join the decision of the two co-authors Prof. Franz Adlkofer (Munich) and Prof. Niels Kuster (Zurich) who are independent of the MUV rector and who strictly refused from very beginning to withdraw the publications as requested by Prof. Schütz and Prof. Lerchl. Due to the pressure created by the events, the rector sees himself finally forced to replace the industry employee suspected of partiality with a new chair. The successor is a former lawyer in public administration who indeed is independent. In the meetings on June 19, July 24, September 25, and November 13, 2008, under his chair the Council for Scientific Ethics comes to the conclusion that the suspicion of fraud cannot be proven."

I examine how certain politico-aesthetic forms—film, television, sound art, and sonic weapons—make sensible the numbing, out-of-body experiences that have become necessary survival tools for navigating life in the contemporary US, particularly for those populations targeted by white supremacy and toxic masculinity. Using the tools of psychoanalysis, affect theory, science and technology studies, media theory, cultural studies, and critical race studies, I argue that activists need to examine how dissociation is both a weapon of and salve against state and corporate violence in the contemporary US I introduce the concept of white narcissism as a framework for thinking about this dual function of dissociation. On the one hand, white supremacy creates atmospheres and environments of dread for marginalized populations in the US Such atmospheres distribute dissociation across populations to ensure resistance remains near-impossible. Because dissociation produces such profound perceptual upsets—creating out-of-body experiences, a sense that reality is a film or cartoon, a feeling that one is alien and alienated, and sensations of (emotional) numbness and inertia—dissociation creates an ontological cavern from which sufferers are unable to escape. On the other hand, the white narcissism inherent within white supremacy causes dissociation for those that benefit from and enact its diffuse violence. For those passively benefiting from white supremacy, feelings of empathy, warmth, terror, confusion, grief, guilt, and shame are split off, as is the case for narcissism as described in psychological literature. That narcissism is a defensive structure is often overshadowed by its outward displays of grandiose violence, projection, rage, and an inability to see the other as possessing humanity. For white folks in the US to successfully tackle white supremacy, they must understand how their narcissism has protected them from accessing unbearable affects mentioned above. Without the defensive function of narcissism, however, breakdown becomes a very real threat. Because the US creates environments of dread and dissociation for most of those living in its borders, there do not exist enough institutional, cultural, political, community, emotional, physical, interpersonal, and/or environmental protections to “catch” white folks who may be paralyzed once no longer protected by narcissism."

    "abstract": "How do paradigms shift? Not easily, not smoothly, not without refinement, expansions, and retrenchment, and not without pushback and champions. At least 40 years ago, a movement began to rethink traditional efforts for addressing the major causes of infant mortality and morbidity in industrialized nations: congenital anomalies and low birth weight. Review of observational studies in Europe and basic embryology caused the venerable adage,“prevention in order to be truly preventive must be antenatal”(Ballantyne 1902) to be questioned. The need for a new approach to impact healthy pregnancy outcomes came with recognition that women enter into prenatal care too late to prevent congenital anomalies and the impact of numerous antecedents to low birth weight including intendedness of the conception, interpregnancy intervals, maternal age, maternal pregravid weight status, prepregnancy chronic disease control, exposures to medications and other drugs, and timing of entry into prenatal care. With recognition of these limitations, a new approach to benefit pregnancy outcomes emerged which was designed to reach women with prevention opportunities before conception. In doing so, women and couples would be able to enter into pregnancy informed about risks to their own health and to the health of their pregnancies and offspring and to have taken any preventive steps that made sense to them and their circumstances. The potential significance of this shift can be appreciated by comparing the tradition of prescribing folic acid through multivitamins for its preventive benefits at the first prenatal visit (by which time the window for preventing neural tube defects has closed) versus educating women about the benefits of adequate folic acid exposure prior to entry into prenatal care and providing them with strategies for achieving the recommendation.\nOriginal efforts to include a preconception emphasis in reproductive health care were vested with obstetricians as they represent the usual gateway to pregnancyrelated care at least in the USA and have the most power in defining its parameters. Their acceptance of a paradigm shift was judged essential to successfully prevent common threats to healthy pregnancy outcomes. The earliest known prepregnancy clinic was established in London in 1978 as a hospital-based service. The clinic largely served an interconceptional population of women who were referred because of previous poor pregnancy outcomes including maternal, fetal, and neonatal complications; occasionally a woman referred herself. The founder of the clinic noted that rarely was a physical exam performed; rather,"

    "abstract": "Cancer incidence and mortality are rapidly growing worldwide. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) estimates that one in five men and one in six women worldwide will develop cancer over the course of their lifetime and that one in eight men and one in 11 women will die from their disease. However, countries are facing an overall increase in the absolute number of cancer cases. Asia accounts for nearly half of the new cancer cases and more than half of cancer deaths. There are more than 100 types of cancers. Cancers are a large group of diseases in which there is unregulated, abnormal growth of cells with invasion of the nearby organs and potential to spread to distant parts of the body as well. Some of the changes in the DNA which occur in cancers are caused naturally, whereas some others are caused due to damage caused by exposure to various environmental factors. These exposures may be alcohol, tobacco, diet, physical activity cancer-causing substances, radiation exposure, sunlight, obesity, infectious agents, pollution, radon, workplace and household exposure, ultraviolet light, etc. The current chapter intends to cover the global burden of cancers, etiology of cancers, epidemiology of various cancers, evidence from research, role of different environmental exposures in cancers, and strategies for prevention and control of these factors. Although we may not be able to control and prevent many of the environmental exposures, better understanding of these will help us prepare better strategies to intervene in our fight against cancers."

    "abstract": "Photoacoustic molecular imaging (PMI) is a non-ionizing imaging modality that can provide functional and metabolic information at clinically relevant penetration depth (~ 2 cm) with submillimeter spatial resolution. This doctoral dissertation focuses on applying PMI to measure the activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), an enzymatic marker of cancer progression capable of altering the tumor microenvironment. Photoacoustic lifetime imaging (PALI) is used to probe the transient absorption of an activatable probe capable of changing its excited-state lifetime from short (1–10 ns) to long (1–10 µs) upon cleavage by MMP-2. Several models were developed to test the hypothesis of lifetime contrast between the inactive and active form of the probe. A series of peptide-based activatable photoacoustic probes of varying length and structure were synthesized. In order to enlighten the structure/function relationship and identify the optimal probe, we compared their dimerization and separation efficiency, activation rate, and photoacoustic lifetime signal strength with respect to a non-activatable control. Our long-term goal is to implement this technique to image the activity of enzymes involved in pathological processes in clinical settings. To this end, we have developed a portable multimodal imaging system for the simultaneous visualization of ultrasound anatomical images and PALI enzymatic activity. Ultimately, this technique could be translated into an early-stage cancer diagnostic or prognostic tool, as well as for personalized treatment planning or continuous monitoring of treatment efficacy."

It has proven to give outstanding results over the years and was succesfully completed with the discovery of the Brout-Englert-Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at CERN. However, several observations escape its reach: the matter-antimatter asymmetry, the nature of Dark Matter or the quantization of the electric charge. These are all examples of measured facts not explained by the Standard Model formalism and that call for an extension to a Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) theory. In this thesis, we have looked for evidence of new physics using proton-proton collision data produced by CERN’s Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Collected from 2016 to 2018 by the CMS detector, it corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 136 fb . After an introduction to the theoretical context and the experimental tools, two analyses are presented. The first one is a search for Dark Matter particles recoiling against a jet and leaving the detector unnoticed. With this” monojet” analysis, we are able to exclude mediator masses up to 1.8 TeV, and masses of Dark Matter particles up to 700 GeV. The second analysis is a search for fractionally charged particles. Using the fact that their stopping power is lower than Standard Model particles, we are able to exclude their existence up to masses of 765 GeV for a charge of 2/3."

    "abstract": "Mid-2007 Prof. Alexander Lerchl, biologist at the private Jacobs University in Bremen and member of the German Commission on Radiological Protection (SSK) of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (BfS), informs the rector of the Medical University of Vienna (MUV), Prof. Wolfgang Schütz, about a serious suspicion: the findings of research carried out at the Division of Occupational Medicine of his university and published in Mutation Research in 2005 (Diem et al.) are most likely fraudulent. Shortly thereafter, he makes the same accusation against another study from the same laboratory, which was published in the International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health (IAOEH) at the beginning of 2008 (Schwarz et al.). In spring 2008, the rector mandates the newly appointed Council for Scientific Ethics of MUV, which consists of three persons he trusts, to clarify the expressed suspicion. Without thoroughly examining the allegations, this Council confirms the accusation of data fabrication already after its first meeting on May 16, 2008. As a result, the rector demands of the authors to immediately retract their publications from Mutation Research and the International Archives. He also demands of the editors-just like Prof. Lerchl did before-to remove the publications from their scientific journals because of a suspected serious scientific fraud. A first press release by the rector and a first report in the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel written by the journalist Manfred Dworschak immediately broadcast the allegedly confirmed fraud scandal to the whole world.\nHowever, a few days after the meeting of the Council for Scientific Ethics it is accidentally revealed that the rector-appointed Council chair has been a lawyer employed by the Austrian mobile phone industry. Because of suspicion of partiality, Prof. Hugo Rüdiger, the former director of the Clinical Division of Occupational Medicine and corresponding author of both publications, requests the immediate removal of this Council chair who, according to the Council’s statutes, should never have been appointed to this position. He also withdraws the signatures he gave to letters presented to him and addressed to the editors of the two journals, in which he had declared his willingness to retract the publications. The team member accused of data fabrication follows his example. Thus, they both join the decision of the two co-authors Prof. Franz Adlkofer (Munich) and Prof. Niels Kuster (Zurich) who are independent of the MUV rector and who strictly refused from very beginning to withdraw the publications as requested by Prof. Schütz and Prof. Lerchl. Due to the pressure created by the events, the rector sees himself finally forced to replace the industry employee suspected of partiality with a new chair. The successor is a former lawyer in public administration who indeed is independent. In the meetings on June 19, July 24, September 25, and November 13, 2008, under his chair the Council for Scientific Ethics comes to the conclusion that the suspicion of fraud cannot be proven."

Three days later, at 11: 02 am on August 9, a second bomb, codenamed Fat Man, was dropped on Nagasaki, resulting in 74,000 lives lost. Understandably, because of the deployment of Little Boy and Fat Man, the use of nuclear energy has been highly controversial in Japan.\nSimultaneously, the bombings initiated the beginning of a national peace and antinuclear movement, which was started and led by the surviving atomic bomb victims, the hibakusha. The antinuclear movement would also grow to include the use of nuclear energy, which Japan turned to after WWII to meet its growing energy needs and end reliance on foreign oil."

    "abstract": "Introduction\nIn 2022, the European Space Agency (ESA) held the first astronaut selection since the beginning of space flight that allowed physically impaired astronaut candidates to be selected in an inclusive European astronaut corp. The main objective of the ‘parastronaut feasibility project’ is to investigate if physical performance tests (PPTs) should be part of future astronaut recruitments for an inclusive ESA astronaut corps to test their flight readiness. The objectives of this study are (1) to assess if future (para-)astronaut recruitment campaigns should include PPTs to ensure flight readiness, safety, and mission success; (2) if so, which areas of physical performance should be tested to mimic nominal and off-nominal crew activities during all phases of a space mission; and (3) to assess whether PPTs are compatible with the ethical principles of equal opportunity for an inclusive pool of astronaut candidates.\nMethods\n58 subject matter experts with specialisations in space physiology, operational human space flight, space medicine, medical ethics or parasports were interviewed in two rounds using the Delphi method. Both qualitative and quantitative data were obtained, analysed, categorised, and visualised using the qualitative research tool NVivo and Excel.\nResults\nTwo thirds of the experts were in favour of adding PPTs to future astronaut selections and recommended to implement them for both physically unimpaired and physically impaired astronaut candidates. The main physical skills that should be examined are space-related, mission-specific coordination skills of the upper extremities, followed by endurance performance and stamina, dexterity of the upper extremities, motor learning ability and mobility.\nConclusion\nBased on this study, it is clear that PPTs should be part of future astronaut selection campaigns. However, the content of these PPTs must be carefully evaluated and validated using existing data on crew activities before, during, and after space flight, while considering equal opportunities in the context of human space flight. Historical considerations have influenced current astronaut requirements, but this study's findings indicate a need to reassess these requirements for future inclusive selection campaigns, as their validity and necessity remain uncertain."

Severe financial constraints on research and public policy, media pressure, and public anxiety make such questions of immense current concern not just to philosophers but to scientists, governments, public bodies, and the general public. In the last decade there has been an explosion of theorizing about causality in philosophy, and also in the sciences. This literature is both fascinating and important, but it is involved and highly technical. This makes it inaccessible to many who would like to use it, philosophers and scientists alike. This book is an introduction to philosophy of causality-one that is highly accessible: to scientists unacquainted with philosophy, to philosophers unacquainted with science, and to anyone else lost in the labyrinth of philosophical theories of causality. It presents key philosophical accounts, concepts and methods, using examples from the sciences to show how to apply philosophical debates to scientific problems."

    "abstract": "A star is a large self-luminous cosmic ball of gas, primarily hydrogen, that is kept together by its own gravity and shines by radiation produced by internal energy sources. The hydrostatic and thermal balance of a star is often maintained by the nuclear fusion that is occurring inside, in the hottest and densest parts, is exerting radiation pressure that is pushing outwards in addition to the object’s inherent selfgravity pulling inwards.\nYoung stars are made of the same stuff as the molecular cloud from which they originally formed, with a hydrogen composition of approximately 74 percent, helium content of approximately 25 percent, and metal content of approximately one percent (Freedman & William III 2008). The aging of a star results in some of its component parts having undergone nuclear fusion, which results in the transformation of lighter elements into heavier ones. The star’s inner core is typically where this conversion occurs, leaving the star surface unchanged. Stars can be classified as: low-mass M∗< 2M⊙, intermediate-mass stars 2M⊙− 8M⊙ and high-mass stars M∗> 8M⊙(Zinnecker & Yorke 2007). By studying the environment in which stars are formed and understanding of the process involved in their formation, information may be obtained on star evolution."

Mitochondrial function and capacity determine whether germ cells are fertilizable, and embryos can safely reach developmental expectations. Impaired mitochondrial biogenesis and defects in mitochondrial DNA result in low birth rates, infertility, and, more seriously, unhealthy offspring with inherited and irreversible metabolic diseases. In recent years, mitochondrial transfer and transplantation have contributed greatly to the field of assisted reproductive technology, especially with advances in biotechnology. Much effort has been invested in refining mitotherapy techniques, aiming at improving the safety, efficacy, and accessibility of the treatment, while reducing costs, labor, and ethical issues. Recent research has shown numerous changes in the approaches with innovative ideas and new materials. This review highlights the role of mitochondria in the reproductive system and the current efforts to improve the outcomes in ART cases with mitochondrial issues. We also summarize different types of mitochondrial transplantation techniques and emphasize the importance of mitochondria selection for reproductive purposes."

    "abstract": "For anyone keeping score in the long-running conflict between ufologists and skeptics over the reality of UFOs, the home team has fared none too brilliantly of late. Whether the cases are new, newly familiar, or old and well-known classics, the skeptics have taken shots with increasing frequency—and as I see it, with increasing accuracy. The opposition is on a roll, as ufologists who read the Skeptical Inquirer (presumably there are a few) must be all too aware. In those pages we can find conventional explanations for such well-publicized cases as the Valentich disappearance, movie footage of a supposed UFO from the Chilean Air Force, and the Cash-Landrum physical injury case. 1 Just in the past three years or so solutions have appeared for a giant UFO reported by multiple witnesses in the Yukon in 1996, and even the 1965 Exeter sighting, one that many of us—myself included—thought would stand forever as an unknown. 2 Other skeptics with ties to the Skeptical Inquirer and its parent organization have gunned down the Phoenix Lights. 3 The problem is not just that skeptics offer explanations—they have always done that, just not always with very creditable results. The problem is that these recent explanations have been difficult to discredit. Instead of flimsy speculations the skeptics have presented hard facts and sound arguments to build a persuasive case that a conventional solution is the right solution for reports we ufologists have trusted were insoluble.\nThose of us long convinced that UFOs are real might shrug off this string of successes and say that we have always known that most reports resolve into mundane solutions, so why get the jitters over more of the same? Why even worry about the loss of a few high-quality cases, since a few classics are bound to unravel from time to time in the light of new information or interpretation? We expect such casualties and leave them behind when they happen, since we can take comfort in a backlog as well as an incoming stream of unknowns, both of which continue to nourish our conviction that no matter how many reports turn out to be false alarms, a hard core of unconventional UFOs truly exists underneath it all."

They are usually encountered by students in the form of: Pauli matrices, and SU (2) & SO (4) rotation groups. These objects did not originally appear in the neat form presented to students in modern mathematics or physics courses. What is presented to students by instructors is usually polished and complete due to many years of reworking. Often neither students of physics, mathematics or their instructors have an understanding about how these objects came into existence, or became incorporated into their respected subject in the first place. This study was done to bridge the gaps between the history of quaternions and their associated rotation groups, and the subject matter that students encounter in their course work."

    "abstract": "The work of this PhD thesis is dedicated to developing a standard measurement system to ensure the SI traceability of high pulsed power in the nanosecond and subnanosecond domain (HPPNS). This traceability is mandatory for the accurate and precise measurements of the voltage waveforms which constitutes the key element of systems based on high pulsed power. A calibration system has been developed for the characterization of high voltage pulses of amplitudes up to 500 kV with rise times as low as few hundreds of picoseconds.The developed HPPNS measurement system is divided into four components: The voltage divider, the termination load, the high-voltage connectors, and the transition cones. The voltage divider is the central component of this measurement system as it permits the analysis of HPPNS waveforms through a calibrated oscilloscope by lowing the voltage amplitudes of the HPPNS waveforms to adequate levels which could be measured through an oscilloscope and without waveform deformation. Some voltage dividers of the scientific literature are discussed and compared. The voltage divider designed through analytical and numerical calculations has a high value of the division ratio which is relatively constant as a function of frequency up to at least 2 GHz, together with a linear phase response. However, its performances in terms of measuring accurately and precisely the incident HPPNS waveforms depend also on the characteristics of the transmission line termination load since the reflections from an inadequately matched line termination load could lead to the misunderstanding of the measured waveform at the output of the divider. A 50 Ω line termination load is developed and characterized. It has high insulation properties for voltage amplitudes up to 500 kV and a maximum reflection coefficient of -27 dB as a function of frequencies up to 2 GHz. The characterization of the complete HPPNS measurement system was carried out in two steps. Firstly, the HPPNS measurement system was characterized at low levels of input power by two different methods, namely, VNA characterization and characterization through a SI traceable high frequency attenuation measurement method. The results obtained from these two methods were compared to the CST modelling results and all of these results were found to be in good agreement with each other. These characterizations demonstrated that the developed HPPNS measurement system possesses a high division ratio of around 85 dB, a bandwidth of 2 GHz, and a linear phase response. Furthermore, a 7 GHz bandwidth commercial attenuator was added at the output of the divider and this whole system was re-characterized by both low power methods. The results obtained are as follows: almost 110 dB of division ratio, a bandwidth of 2 GHz and a linear phase response. In the second characterization step, this system was tested at high power levels through a Max generator. Different high voltage waveforms of voltage peaks as high as 300 kV and rise times as low as 420 picoseconds were successfully measured through this system and an uncertainty budget is drafted. The measurement uncertainties for these high voltage measurements were calculated to be 3.4 % for the voltage peaks and 87 picoseconds for the temporal parameters."

    "abstract": "The concept of a soul or vital force is consistent across scientific, medical, theological, and philosophical thought1. The soul is often described as contained within specific organs but separate from the body, and it is unsurprising that its location has been a subject of great debate throughout history2. Despite much contention, those historically in search of the soul have generally agreed that it is the essence of a person–their true and immortal self1, 3. Indeed, when confronted with the challenge of identifying themselves, most people point to their chest or, approximately, their heart. This cardiocentric model of who we are is described in humanity’s earliest writings from the third millennium BCE, indicating that Ancient Egyptians believed souls were immortal and located within the hearts of impermanent bodies4. The related idea of the pneuma–ancient Greek for breath, spirit, or soul–represents one among many similar beliefs about the essence of human life5. Consistent with the heart’s exalted status throughout history6, and until very recently, irreversible cardiac arrest was considered the medical standard for death7-9. Which is to say, when your heart stopped beating, you stopped being. However, the importance of other bodily organs did not go unnoticed by our ancestors. Notable philosophers such as Plato and Descartes championed the brain as the locus of the soul10-13 and modern definitions of death rest squarely on the structural and functional integrity of the brain, not the heart7, 8.\nA fascination with the brain is also present in Ancient Egyptian writings as evidenced by the lucid descriptions of agnosias, automatic behaviors, and emotional disturbances associated with head injuries as reported in the Edwin Smith Papyrus14. Around 200 BCE, the famous Greek physician Galen noted that stimulating the heart induced no cognitive or perceptual response but that the same procedure applied to the brain had marked effects5. Some prehistoric human skulls, discovered to be over 5000 years old, feature holes with tapered edges that suggest they were formed and allowed to heal while the person was alive15, 16, which is evidence of a surgical technique called trepanation that is still used today to relieve increased intracranial pressure that can cause altered mental states and death17. Unsurprisingly, our ancestors noticed that our heads and their contents are major anatomical correlates of how we feel, what we do, and who we are18. As they would have observed frequently in soldiers returning from war, getting hit in the head could change someone’s personality and behavior, as well as erase their memories19-21. As modern clinicians know, a person suffering a head injury then would have, in their own words, reported feeling “like a different person” 22. Beyond brain injury, the most extreme changes would be associated with death, including a loss of speech and all movement by which we infer thought and experience or “consciousness”. Then, like now, people might have seemed to live behind their eyes until they could no longer open them and the care with which burial and cremation practices were carried out tens of thousands of years ago23 suggests that when faced with the death of loved ones, our ancestors likely wondered where they had gone and if they would ever meet again."

The highly marketed pink ribbon, criticized for being tied to pharmaceutical interests, presents breast cancer as normal and pretty in pink. Yet, the statistics of breast cancer remain the same. Expert on the preventative causes of cancer, Dr. Samuel S. Epstein has been watching the debates around breast cancer for more than four decades. He asks, with all the talk about early detection, mammograms, improved treatment, and the race for the cure, why don't we ever hear about breast cancer prevention? Dr. Epstein knows the substantial research that has directly associated many factors of daily life with the development of the disease. The steps that can be taken to prevent it are often amazingly simple, but rarely make the headlines. Here, the evidence is presented and preventative choices are carefully and accesibly outlined. In presenting this critical information that all Americans should know about, Stop Breast Cancer Before it Starts empowers women to take charge of their health and make a real difference in the fight against cancer."

It’s designed to show that psychological needs of the patient are an important aspect that should be considered for optimizing the effects of cancer treatment, no less than genetic, immunological, physiological and other medical features that are often considered as necessary components of personalized medicine. Using evidence-based information, the book describes the different ways cancer touches upon a person’s life, including emotional, physical, and social changes, important decisions, and support structure. It also details the phases every cancer patient encounters along the way, from getting tested and waiting for the diagnosis, to treatments, survival, and confronting one’s mortality. Psycho-oncology for the Clinician will serve to contribute to the further scientific development of psycho-oncology, expand its use as a treatment modality, strengthen its status as an essential component of cancer care, and promote the acceptance of psycho-oncology as the new evidence-based constituent of personalized medicine in oncology."

Due to the extremity of the environmental conditions in Space, the architectural product defines the whole accessible environment of the user. In addition, Space habitats are high-risk and high-cost projects, addressing rather unexplored issues. As a result, unquestioned preconceptions or assumptions are needed to be avoided. This situation requires comprehensive research on human–environment interaction. Furthermore, the complexity of the design problem necessitates contribution from various disciplinary fields, calling for interdisciplinary design approaches. It might be argued that hitherto realized designs of Space habitats are under the influence of excessive technical and cost constraints, and being formed by engineering-dominated design approaches. Whereas the inclusion of the architects to the spacecraft design had been to provide an environment to support human well-being, the research area of the field has been expanded since. This thesis is an inquiry of Space architecture through its design considerations and design process, hoping to find potential reflections both on architecture and on Space architecture, in means of design approaches and understanding of human–environment interaction."

Through his therapeutic work, Thoresen has learned that one cannot simply ‘fight’demons, as they will ‘translocate’to other people or return later.

The author presents a lifetime’s knowledge–the fruit of more than half a century’s practical and clinical experience–in the pages of this book, offering a better understanding of health and disease. He recounts numerous personal experiences of demonic entities and explains how demons are created. Thoresen advises on the prevention of the demonic effects of natural and artificial radiation, and how we can defend and ultimately free ourselves from demonic influence.

To explore why, this study investigates the socio-technical challenges facing the SMIP, with a strong emphasis on the “social” side of the equation. It explains its two primary sources of data, a systematic review of the academic literature coupled with observation of seven major SMIP events. It offers a history of the SMIP rollout, including a summary of 67 potential benefits as well as often-discussed technical challenges, before delving into pertinent non-technical challenges, specifically vulnerability as well as consumer resistance and ambivalence. In doing so, the paper not only presents a critique of SMIP, it also offers a review of academic studies on consumer responses to smart meters, an analysis of the intersection between smart meters and other social concerns such as poverty or the marginalization of rural areas, and the generation of policy lessons."

The fetal scan project, which took place in 2015, was carried out in the German city of Cologne over a period of three months. This essay reflects on my experiences during those months. For the fetal scan project, I offered to work for pregnant people, to do their housework or other work, following a feminist idea about wages for housework. But instead of receiving a wage in return, I wanted to get their take-home fetal ultrasound image which they are socially expected to cherish as a precious keepsake.\nIn Germany, as in other countries, ultrasound examinations are routinely performed on pregnant patients to track fetal growth. Besides having a diagnostic value, ultrasound examinations allow pregnant patients to view real-time, moving images of the fetus on a computer screen and to take home with them printouts for personal use. I wanted to get from pregnant people this take-home keepsake fetal image. By then, I had already spent almost fifteen years drawing artistic fetal forms by hand. Many of my artistic fetal forms were made of paper and wood, which are traditional materials. Elsewhere I have written about the artistic creation of a handmade form I call “fetus-phallus”(Gonzalez Suero 2022a). After reworking the phallus as an extension of my larger artistic practice with fetal forms, I now wanted to repurpose the manufactured, technical image of the growing fetus generated by the ultrasound machine. So I decided that I needed to get other people’s fetal scans and that, for this to happen, I would take it upon myself to work for them. A series of unusual but necessary exchanges began to unfold in the context of my fetal scan project. These out-of-the-ordinary exchanges, in turn, revealed to me the individual needs of pregnant people."

We provide a comprehensive assessment of the possibility of silicon-based biochemistry, based on a review of what is known and what has been modeled, even including speculative work. We assess whether or not silicon chemistry meets the requirements for chemical diversity and reactivity as compared to carbon. To expand the possibility of plausible silicon biochemistry, we explore silicon’s chemical complexity in diverse solvents found in planetary environments, including water, cryosolvents, and sulfuric acid. In no environment is a life based primarily around silicon chemistry a plausible option. We find that in a water-rich environment silicon’s chemical capacity is highly limited due to ubiquitous silica formation; silicon can likely only be used as a rare and specialized heteroatom. Cryosolvents (e.g., liquid N2) provide extremely low solubility of all molecules, including organosilicons. Sulfuric acid, surprisingly, appears to be able to support a much larger diversity of organosilicon chemistry than water."

The later part of the chapter covers the design control process with stages of user needs translating to requirements, the design process with the design outputs, design verification conforming that the design is right, followed by design validation that proves that a right medical device is made. The risk management, usability engineering, and security and privacy risk management are part of the product realization process. Having a clear regulatory strategy and plan beginning with the list of target countries and intended use followed by identification of all the applicable product standards is vital. The process thus culminates in the design and development file which is a formal document that describes the design history of the medical device."

    "abstract": "Despite the extensive and intensive investigations so far, there are still significant gaps in our knowledge and understanding of the chemical and biological mechanisms of antioxidants. For instance, studies aimed at prevention or intervention of diseases with common exogenous antioxidants have shown mixed outcomes. In relation to this also there does not seem to be a general consensus about the actual biological mechanisms of many compounds including dietary polyphenols, which have been classically considered as antioxidants. Even somewhat surprisingly, antioxidants in general and radical scavengers in particular were never properly described in thermodynamical terms. One of the most commonly studied aspects of antioxidants is their ability to neutralize free radicals by donating electrons or hydrogen atoms. However, upon perusal of the ever-increasing literature on the subject, it would not be long before one is confronted with the fact that the thermodynamics and kinetics of hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) reactions of antioxidants are often either confused with each other or lumped together in perplexity. A detailed understanding of the chemical aspects of antioxidant molecules is deemed crucial as it may enable unravelling some of the controversies and uncertainties surrounding them. The detailed chemical knowledge of antioxidants may also serve as a foundation upon which more complex and biologically relevant predictive models could be built. With this in mind and being inspired by a couple of intriguing observations from my related previous studies, I have attempted in the present PhD study to investigate the thermochemical aspects of the HAT reactions of common antioxidant molecules using quantum molecular computations. In summary, the thermodynamic basis of the radical scavenging activities of antioxidants was shown to be their abilities to donate two hydrogen atoms with relative enthalpy changes below 104.206 kcal mol-1. The important kinetic parameters BDE and BDFE were reliably estimated as the relative energy changes accompanying the formation of suitable DSs. Depending on the class of compounds, DSs were proposed to be electronically and/or vibrationally excited species. Moreover, ab initio UHF method was shown to be remarkably adequate for the study of HAT reactions of antioxidants. The above findings may warrant further investigation as they may not only contribute to our general understanding of antioxidants but also have far-reaching implications on several fundamental aspects of antioxidants' HAT reactions and the computational tools recommended for their study. Furthermore, the findings of this PhD study can form the basis for robust and inclusive quantitative structure-activity relationships of antioxidants."

    "abstract": "Travelers encounter body scanners in airports. 1 And, many travelers think of them in terms of the airport hassles. Most of us, therefore, do not associate scanners with freedom, but in terms of intrusion and limited access. They may signify hassles. I don’t want to focus on the hassles as indicative of the meaning we should attach to the scanners but rather the deeper significance of current security procedures, most of which are constructed with at least some reference to perceived implications for the public. Thus, although body scanners are a formidable presence in airports, glowing, often in the distance, and they constitute control over the space through which one aims to pass, in terms of this chapter, scanners serve a social function slightly different. And, in this, they represent access and freedom of movement; both access through the differently regulated departure gates and into the airport shopping malls that have appeared on the other side of the security check points. In this understanding, the scanner transforms the meaning of access that has governed social control in democratic societies since the 19th century. 2 The idea for seeing the significance of the scanner for law in a different way emerged from a political rally where far more people were given access than would have been possible by means of a more conventional screening process involving identification and background checks. It was a rally for Senator “Bernie” 3 Sanders who was running for the president of the United States in the winter of 2015–16 that turned my understanding of the scanners 180 degrees, if not on its head. The “Bernie” Rally at UMass, Amherst, led me to rethink the meaning of scanners. As thousands from the university community filed into our substantial basketball arena, on a weekday afternoon in early March, we were confronted with Secret Service agents monitoring the doors.

    "abstract": "Fueled by stimulus funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), electric utilities have accelerated their deployment of smart meters to millions of homes across the United States with help from the Department of Energy’s Smart Grid Investment Grant program. As the meters multiply, so do issues concerning the privacy and security of the data collected by the new technology. This Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) promises to increase energy efficiency, bolster electric power grid reliability, and facilitate demand response, among other benefits. However, to fulfill these ends, smart meters must record near-real time data on consumer electricity usage and transmit the data to utilities over great distances via communications networks that serve the smart grid. Detailed electricity usage data offers a window into the lives of people inside of a home by revealing what individual appliances they are using, and the transmission of the data potentially subjects this information to interception or theft by unauthorized third parties or hackers.\nUnforeseen consequences under federal law may result from the installation of smart meters and the communications technologies that accompany them. This report examines federal privacy and cybersecurity laws that may apply to consumer data collected by residential smart meters. It begins with an examination of the constitutional provisions in the Fourth Amendment that may apply to the data. As we progress into the 21st century, access to personal data, including information generated from smart meters, is a new frontier for police investigations. The Fourth Amendment generally requires police to have probable cause to search an area in which a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy. However, courts have used the third-party doctrine to deny protection to information a customer gives to a business as part of their commercial relationship. This rule is used by police to access bank records, telephone records, and traditional utility records. Nevertheless, there are several core differences between smart meters and the general third-party cases that may cause concerns about its application. These include concerns expressed by the courts and Congress about the ability of technology to potentially erode individuals’ privacy."

This book–an imaginative, practical and accessible guide to our inner organs–is written for anyone who wants to improve their health and develop resiliency against illness. Although trained as a medical doctor, Olaf Koob has the vision and experience of a holistic physician. He has surveyed diverse medical systems–orthodox medicine, naturopathy, homeopathy, Chinese, ayurvedic and anthroposophic medicine–and found their common substance. Using this knowledge, he relates the essence of each human organ: its position, colour, form, embryonic development, function and characteristic attributes. Thus, the organs begin to tell their own stories, revealing their ‘biography’, physiognomy and the illnesses they are prone to. Inspired by esoteric wisdom, Koob creates living images of the pancreas and the hormone system and shows how the spleen, liver, gall bladder, heart, kidneys, lungs and reproductive organs relate to the wider cosmos. He describes the nature of poison and detoxification, good and bad nutrition and the importance of secretion and elimination. If the Organs Could Speak is a unique work that enables us to think more creatively about our bodies and how they function, and to help us cope with crises, suffering and pain."

    "abstract": "With the planet increasingly threatened with catastrophe and perhaps even collapse, many seekers are looking to past, proven models to create meaningful change in their lives. One such model is Buddhism’s Four Noble Truths: the reality of suffering, the root cause of suffering, the end of suffering, and the path to the end of suffering. This fresh, timely book taps and modifies that ancient wisdom to address the pressing environmental and spiritual crises facing us. In The Four Global Truths, author Darrin Drda contends that as global temperatures rise and natural systems decline, humanity is forced to confront the destructiveness of unfettered material progress and mechanistic thinking. He posits a more enlightened worldview that honors the interdependence of all forms of life and aspects of reality, a concept increasingly see as a practical and compassionate approach to averting disaster. Writing in a warm, open style recalling that of Eckhart Tolle in The New Earth, Drda integrates elements of Western philosophy, transpersonal psychology, deep ecology, modern cosmology, and quantum physics to get at the heart of worldwide ecological suffering. In the process he encourages a responsible and joyful—and ultimately healing—participation in this critical moment in life.

The existing radio frequency (RF) communication spectrum is insufficient to meet the demands of future high-datarate 5G services. Optical wireless communication (OWC), which uses an ultra-wide range of unregulated spectrum, has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the RF spectrum crisis. It has attracted growing research interest worldwide in the last decade for indoor and outdoor applications. OWC offloads huge data traffic applications from RF networks. A 100 Gb/s data rate has already been demonstrated through OWC. It offers services indoors as well as outdoors, and communication distances range from several nm to more than 10000 km. This paper provides a technology overview and a review on optical wireless technologies, such as visible light communication, light fidelity, optical camera communication, free space optical communication, and light detection and ranging. We survey the key technologies for understanding OWC and present state-of-the-art criteria in aspects, such as classification, spectrum use, architecture, and applications. The key contribution of this paper is to clarify the differences among different promising optical wireless technologies and between these technologies and their corresponding similar existing RF technologies."

    "abstract": "Construction work and industry, although highly important to Nigeria‟ s developmental processes, is characterised by high level of risks occurrence and hazards. The trend is exacerbated by the insecure manner in which the construction workers are recruited, placed and managed as well as non-enforcement of existing safety laws in the sector. This raises concern about the type of safety training provided in the industry and the instructional method used in imparting such safety trainings. Previous studies have focused largely on the causes, prevention, control, safety legislations and provision of safety trainings with little emphasis on safety training instructional methods. This study, therefore, determined the effects of syndicate (STM) and guided-practice (GpTM) training methods on occupational health and safety competencies (OHSC) of workers in the construction industry in Oyo State, Nigeria. The moderating effects of employees‟ literacy level and employment status were also examined.\nThis study was anchored on multiple cause and social learning theories while the pretest-posttest, control group quasi experimental design with a 3x3x2 factorial matrix was adopted. Purposive sampling technique was employed in selecting three reputable construction organisations in Oyo State. The workers in the three organisations who met the study‟ s inclusion criteria were randomised into STM,(12), GpTM (11) and Lecture method (12)(Control) groups while treatment lasted six weeks. Construction Industry Occupational Health and Safety Competencies Questionnaire (r= 0.85), training guides for STM, GpTM and lecture method were used for data collection. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics, Analysis of covariance and Scheffe post-hoc test at 0.05 level of significance."

He dissects the complex history of states’ use of science for conquest, glory and economic growth and shows the challenges of governing risk–from nuclear weapons to genetic modification, artificial intelligence to synthetic biology. He shows why the governance of science has become one of the biggest challenges of the twenty-first century, ever more prominent in daily politics and policy. Whereas science is ordered around what we know and what is, politics engages what we feel and what matters. How can we reconcile the two, so that crucial decisions are both well informed and legitimate? The book proposes new ways to organize democracy and government, both within nations and at a global scale, to better shape science and technology so that we can reap more of the benefits and fewer of the harms. Also available as an audiobook."

    "abstract": "There are two questions often asked of risk communication: what has been learned from past work, and what is needed to push the field forward? Drawing on the experience of leading risk researchers and practitioners, Effective Risk Communication focuses on answering these questions. The book draws together new examples of research and practice, from contexts as diverse as energy generation, human health, nuclear waste, climate change, food choice, and social media. This book treats risk communication as much more than the interchange of risk information between experts and non-experts; rather, it aims to emphasize the diversity in viewpoints and practices. In each specially commissioned chapter, the authors reflect on the theoretical and applied underpinnings of their best projects, and comment on how their approach could be used effectively by others. Building upon each other, the chapters will provoke new discussion and action around a discipline which many feel is neither meeting important needs in practice, nor living up to its potential in research. Through a more careful examination of the work already done in risk communication, the book will help develop better, more reflective practice for fl the future."

    "abstract": "New high-data-rate multimedia services and applications are evolving continuously and exponentially increasing the demand for wireless capacity of fifth-generation (5G) and beyond. The existing radio frequency (RF) communication spectrum is insufficient to meet the demands of future high-datarate 5G services. Optical wireless communication (OWC), which uses an ultra-wide range of unregulated spectrum, has emerged as a promising solution to overcome the RF spectrum crisis. It has attracted growing research interest worldwide in the last decade for indoor and outdoor applications. OWC offloads huge data traffic applications from RF networks. A 100 Gb/s data rate has already been demonstrated through OWC. It offers services indoors as well as outdoors, and communication distances range from several nm to more than 10000 km. This paper provides a technology overview and a review on optical wireless technologies, such as visible light communication, light fidelity, optical camera communication, free space optical communication, and light detection and ranging. We survey the key technologies for understanding OWC and present state-of-the-art criteria in aspects, such as classification, spectrum use, architecture, and applications. The key contribution of this paper is to clarify the differences among different promising optical wireless technologies and between these technologies and their corresponding similar existing RF technologies."

Among those acquisitions parameters we find the b-values (e.g. b-value is a factor that reflects the strength and timing of those gradients used to generate Diffusion-Weighted Images; the higher the b-value, the stronger the diffusion effects), voxel size (the smaller the voxel size the higher the quality) and diffusion directions (as the number of directions increases the acquisition time increases as well). This project, places all of them of the focus of several clinical MRI studies performed on healthy subjects in the IDIBAPS’ MRI core facility. Those studies have been grouped into 5 datasets according to different acquisition protocols; in addition, 8 new acquisition proposal are first undergone and analysed. Results show that as expected those parameters play a crucial role in image quality; however, each one of them has a different weight over those quality measurements. This will be discussed by splitting the results into datasets. Furthermore, the analysis performed on the protocol proposals confirm that they have reached what was their goal, to demonstrate that depending on the purpose of the scanner (emergency MRI, clinical MRI and research MRI) a specifical acquisition sequence can be used."

    "abstract": "The main motivation of this manuscript is to deepen our understanding of phenomena with a temporal component. Most machine learning algorithms and high-dimensional statistical models are largely studied under assumptions of independence of observations. Indeed, there are fewer and technically more demanding tools for measure concentration under this setting. This leads to non-asymptotic control of deviations being more challenging in the more realistic setup of dependence between observations. Very frequently, an evolution with time is obvious in the underlying model but not always taken into account in the proposed methods and the inference results.\nThis thesis investigates various non-parametric and high-dimensional inference problems including hypothesis testing, support recovery, prediction in matrix regression and estimation of dynamic topic models that combine matrix factorization and auto-regression. Although they share a common motivation, the chapters presented in this thesis can be read and understood separately as they are focusing on specific problems."

    "abstract": "The modern regulatory state is a creature of 20th century politics, and the New Deal consensus that dominated thinking about the relationship between government regulation and the market for most of that century. That regime exists now in a very different political environment, one in which parties and voters are more ideologically polarized and digitally connected than at any time in the modern regulatory era. This article examines the influence of this new politics on one such 20th century regulatory system--the regulation of energy market entry--through the lens of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) that participate in energy infrastructure siting conflicts. The analysis is built around a data set comprising information about more than 400 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) whose missions include active opposition to one or more of nine different types of energy projects between 2000 and 2017, including various types of fossil fuel infrastructure, renewable energy facilities, and smart grid technology. The focus is on the tactics each NGO uses to oppose energy projects, and the issue arguments advanced by each NGO to oppose those projects. The results are consistent with the notion that ideological polarization and digital communication are affecting the nature of siting conflicts over energy infrastructure. NGOs devote the lion’s share of their efforts not to inside strategies like formal lobbying, but rather to mobilizing the broader public to lobby decision-makers, and organize those mobilization efforts focus overwhelmingly around environmental and health risk issues. This holds true not only for dirty energy projects like coal-fired power plants whose health and environmental risks are well-known; but for clean energy projects like wind farms as well."

With the emergence of amyloid-PET tracers,[11 C] Pittsburgh Compound-B in 2004 and later [18 F] florbetapir,[18 F] florbetaben, and [18 F] flumetamol, amyloid-PET has replaced FDG-PET in Alzheimer’s disease anti-amyloid clinical trial treatments to ensure “amyloid positivity” as an entry criterion, and to measure treatment-related decline in cerebral amyloid deposits. MRI has been used to rule out other brain diseases and screen for ‘amyloid-related imaging abnormalities’(ARIAs) of two kinds, ARIA-E and ARIA-H, characterized by edema and micro-hemorrhage, respectively, and, to a lesser extent, to measure changes in cerebral volumes. While early immunotherapy trials of Alzheimer’s disease showed no clinical effects, newer monoclonal antibody trials reported decreases of 27% to 85% in the cerebral amyloid-PET signal, interpreted by the Food and Drug Administration as amyloid removal expected to result in a reduction in clinical decline. However, due to the lack of diagnostic specificity of amyloid-PET tracers, amyloid positivity cannot prevent the inclusion of non-Alzheimer’s patients and even healthy subjects in these clinical trials. Moreover, the “decreasing amyloid accumulation” assessed by amyloid-PET imaging has questionable quantitative value in the presence of treatment-related brain damage (ARIAs). Therefore, future Alzheimer’s clinical trials should disregard amyloid-PET imaging and focus instead on assessment of regional brain function by FDG-PET and MRI monitoring of ARIAs and brain volume loss in all trial patients."

Every risk manager, every risk analyst, every risk researcher must read this book - it is the demarcation point for all further advances in risk policy and risk research. Renn provides authoritative guidance on how to manage risks based on a definitive synthesis of the research literature. The skill with which he builds practical recommendations from solid science is unprecedented. Thomas Dietz, Director, Environmental Science and Policy Program, Michigan State University, USA A masterpiece of new knowledge and wisdom with illustrative examples of tested applications to realworld cases. The book is recommendable also to interested students in different disciplines as a timely textbook on 'risk beyond risk'. Norio Okada, Full Professor and Director at the Disaster Prevention Research Institute (DPRI), Kyoto University, Japan There are classic environmental works such as The Tragedy of the Commons by Hardin, Risk Society by Beck, The Theory of Communicative Action by Habermas, and the seminal volumes by Ostrom on governing the commons. Renn s book fits right into this series of important milestones of environmental studies. Jochen Jaeger, Professor at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada Risk Governance provides a valuable survey of the whole field of risk and demonstrates how scientific, economic, political and civil society actors can participate in inclusive risk governance. Jobst Conrad, Senior Scientist, Social Science Research Center Berlin, Germany Renn offers a remarkably fair-minded and systematic approach to bringing together the diverse fields that have something to say about 'risk'. Risk Governance moves us along the path from the noisy, formative stage of thinking about risk to one with a stronger empirical, theoretical, and analytical foundation. Baruch Fischhoff, PhD, Howard Heinz University Professor, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA 'I cannot describe how impressed I am at the breadth and coherence of Renn's career's work! Written with remarkable clarity and minimal technical jargon... [this] should be required reading in risk courses!' John Graham, former director of the Harvard Risk Center and former deputy director of the Office of Budget and Management of the Unites States Administration This book, for the first time, brings together and updates the groundbreaking work of renowned risk theorist and researcher Ortwin Renn, integrating the major disciplinary concepts of risk in the social, engineering and natural sciences. The book opens with the context of risk handling before flowing through the core topics of assessment, evaluation, perception, management and communication, culminating in a look at the transition from risk management to risk governance and a glimpse at a new understanding of risk in (post)modern societies."

En effet, l’accès à l’information en temps réel concernant l’activité cérébrale est un facteur important permettant la détection de tout changement au niveau cortex du cerveau à un stade précoce. Or, les logiciels actuellement disponibles comparables à celui présenté ici n’offrent qu’une possibilité d’ajustement limitée des paramètres en temps réel ainsi que peu de fonctionnalité permettant l’analyse rapide et efficace des données. Le travail présenté dans ce présent mémoire a été réalisé au sein du groupe IMAGINC. Un groupe de recherche multidisciplinaire ayant comme objectif le développement d’un système d’imagerie cérébrale portatif, non invasif et sans-fil permettant d’imager le cortex entier en temps réel. Le module d’acquisition de données de ce système enregistre l’information de 128 canaux NIRS et 32 canaux EEG ainsi que différents accéléromètres et canaux analogiques le tout par l’entremise d’optodes et d’électrodes placées sur un casque d’enregistrement. Ces données sont ensuite envoyées par un lien de communication sans-fil au logiciel qui recueille et affiche l’état hémodynamique du sujet par l’entremise de son interface graphique. Il est ensuite possible de choisir différentes vues des cartes 2D du cerveau sur lesquelles les changements hémodynamiques sont présentés. La surveillance à distance de l’état du sujet est aussi possible puisque ces données peuvent être retransmises vers un autre ordinateur par un lien sans-fil. De plus, de par son interface graphique conviviale et intuitive, l’usager peut facilement ajuster différents paramètres de test tout au long de l’acquisition de données sans même l’interrompre. Dans le but d’optimiser les paramètres pour chaque sujet, une fonction de calibration automatique ajustant l’intensité d’illumination de chacun des émetteurs en quelques secondes a été implémentée. Pour faciliter le processus de test, il est possible de télécharger des fichiers (bipolaire et montage référentielle) contenant des paramètres de configurations préétablies pour le NIRS et l’EEG. Enfin, il est possible de faire une analyse automatique et rapide de l’état de tous les canaux NIRS durant les tests afin d’assurer une bonne connexion ainsi que la validité des données. Le système conçu est en mesure d’enregistrer et de traiter des données en temps réel sur une période de 24 heures. Les résultats obtenus ont été validés en utilisant des logiciels d’analyse de données NIRS similaires durant des tâches de finger tapping induisant un changement hémodynamique chez les sujets.----------ABSTRACT This master’s thesis presents the design and implementation of a real-time software system to support a bimodal NIRS and EEG brain imaging device. Real-time information on brain activity is an important factor in early detection and diagnosis at the top level of the cortex of various brain disorders. Current software systems provide limited real-time parameter adjustment and automated features for quick and easy analysis. The project presented in this master’s thesis is part of the multidisciplinary IMAGINC research group, with the objective of developing a wireless, non-invasive and portable brain imaging system that allows imaging of the whole cortex in real time. The hardware system is capable of recording data from 128 NIRS and 32 EEG channels, as well as additional accelerometer and analog channels through the optodes and electrodes mounted onto the helmet. The software system acquires the real-time data from the hardware module using a wireless …"

    "abstract": "Nowadays, the number of people infected with HIV/AIDS keeps rising in many countries. How can this risk be managed in society is an issue that gains on relevance. This paper focuses on the topic, how risk is communicated to society in the case of HIV/AIDS in Germany. It also looks at what aspects are emphasized and if different social groups are represented. Two nation-wide campaigns in Germany from 2009 and 2010 are analyzed. The key organizations are the Federal Centre for Health Education, in cooperation with the non-governmental organization German AIDS Aid. The problems are analyzed by using discourse analysis. Therefore the main posters of every campaign were chosen as material. Risk communication theory offers an ideal theoretical foundation for this study. Different aspects, like trustworthiness, amount of information, narratives and models of risk communication are critically introduced. Relating this to the campaigns, the discourse analysis shows that HIV/AIDS is communicated in different ways. In both cases risk is at first place communicated as risk of discrimination and stigmatization. It is concentrated on values rather than safety or health issues. The first campaigns points towards awareness of the theme in society and reinforces passive support, whereas the second one aims towards solidarity and generates sympathy, tolerance, active support, respect and compassion. In both campaigns it is difficult to identify social groups with high prevalence of HIV/AIDS who are clearly targeted. Instead the society as a whole is targeted."

Morin comments it by warning us from inaction and dresses a scheme of action made by the wager and the strategy. I propose to enrich this scheme by adding Ulrich Beck’s discussions on the precautionary principle and the upstream action, and by doing a eulogy of inaction in the frame of the degrowth theory."

    "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a light based interferometric imaging technique that can provide high resolution (5-20 µm at 1300 nm), depth resolved, images in real-time. With recent advances in portable low coherent light sources for OCT it is now possible to achieve ultrahigh axial resolutions (≤ 3 µm) by moving to shorter central wavelengths such as 800 nm while utilizing a broad spectral bandwidth. Our goal was to push ultrahigh resolution OCT technology to in vivo imaging of internal organs for endoscopic assessment of tissue microstructure. This dissertation is separated into technological developments and biomedical imaging studies. Technological developments in this dissertation included development of a high speed, ultrahigh resolution distal scanning catheter. This catheter was based upon a miniature DC micromotor capable of rotational velocities in excess of 100 rps, a diffractive compound lens design that minimized chromatic aberrations, and a mechanical assembly that limited field of view blockage to less than 7.5% and maintained an outer diameter of 1.78 mm (with plastic sheath). In conjunction with the algorithm described in chapter 4 to correct for non-uniform rotational distortion, the overall imaging system was capable of high quality endoscopic imaging of internal organs in vivo. Equipped with the ultrahigh resolution endoscopic OCT system, imaging was performed in small airways and colorectal cancer. Imaging results demonstrated the ability to directly visualization of microstructural details such as airway smooth muscle in the small airways representing a major step forward in pulmonary imaging. With the ability to visualize airway smooth muscle, morphological changes in COPD and related diseases can be further investigated. Additionally, longitudinal changes in an ETBF induced colon cancer model in APCMin mice were studied as well. Quantitative assessment of tissue microarchitecture was performed by measuring the attenuation coefficient to find a bimodal distribution separating normal healthy tissue from polyps. Finally, results from two additional projects were also demonstrated. Chapter 7 shows some results from vascular imaging in a tumor angiogenesis model and middle cerebral artery occlusion model. Chapter 8 describes an endoscopic multimodal OCT and fluorescence imaging platform with results in ex vivo rabbit esophagus."

    "abstract": "Economic theory considers every household as a rational being operating by the principles of bounded rationality to make a home choice with optimum utility in the residential market. This study investigates the impact of the negative externality of a grave on tenants' residential choice. Using Stated Preference method, the study examines three inter-twined problems of residential choice, willingness to pay and market regulatory mechanism. First, is the question on whether the location of a grave within a home affects tenants' residential choice and social welfare? It hypothesized that there is no significant relationship between income, education, family size and accessibility on the choice of home with grave. Second, is the question on economic value of a grave on a residential property's rent? Third, is the question on the efficiency of the Environmental Health law regulating the residential market? Fourth, is the question on the adequacy of neoclassical economics solution to the negative externality of a grave on residential property. The research methodology is dominantly quantitative. In particular, it applies choice modelling in an experimental study agenda to explore the effect of a residential property with a grave on tenants' residential choice and rent. It also examines tenants' sensitivity to a rent discount on a home with a grave in different parts namely, frontage, side, backyard and room. The context is the Private Renter Sector within the informal residential market in Akure, a State capital city in Southwestern Nigeria. To achieve these raison d'êtres, respondents are presented with discrete residential choices developed by Sawtooth software in a stochastic process. The choice context requires some moment of trade-off to reach a stated choice decision, which reveals tenants' WTP. Data analysis involves the use of basic probabilistic models; namely ordinary least square (OLS) and multinomial logit model (MNL). It progresses to the application of a Hierarchical Bayes (HB) model for a more robust and reliable parameter estimates The study reveals that most of the respondents prefer a choice of un-impacted property. The fixed choice model estimates shows that the majority of them would protect their social welfare by WTP 10 percent above the open market value of a property without a grave. Parameter estimates show that preference varies with respect to different locations of a grave within a residential property. Tenants most prefer a property with a grave at the backyard; this is followed by a preference for a home with a grave at the side, frontage and in a room respectively. The model's distribution of WTP estimates shows that a residential property with a grave would lose between 15 and 20 percent in rental. Sensitivity analysis shows that tenants' responsiveness to a high rent discount on residential property with a grave is inelastic; thus exposing the limitation of a neoclassical economics approach to welfare issues. Parameter estimates on attributes importance and contribution to the residential choice decision show that rent, accessibility and other variables all pale into insignificance in the face of the grave factor. The property market regulatory mechanism exemplified by the Environmental Health Law shows ambivalence and lack of definiteness in its exception to the rule. In conclusion, the study noted that the negative externality of a grave on residential property emerges from the violation of property right and partly the law. It problematizes the law and its' implementation as crucial to tenants' residential choice, rental value and welfare. Consequently, it argues for remedies from both legal perspective and market process; and advances a course for …"

This transdisciplinary approach makes the book a unique contribution for researchers, students, policy makers and professionals working in governmental or nongovernmental institutions, as well as anyone interested in society’s well-being and achieving a true social-ecological transformation. It is written in an accessible language in order to reach a broad audience. In 2015, more than 190 world leaders recognized that the world is on a “collision course”(Max-Neef) and committed to 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Many conferences and high-level meetings have been held since then, and one of the most frequently discussed topics is how to finance these goals. There is a widespread belief that coming up with more money for sustainable development will “do the trick”. Usually, the discussions focus on finding additional financial resources in order to achieve the goals faster. In this book it is argued that not only is more money needed, but it needs to be a different kind of money. The book demonstrates that ALL but one of the SDGs are directly linked to our monetary system, which—being completely unnatural—can be seen as the most important, but at the same time least recognized, reason for market failure. Many people think we just need to do more, faster, better. Very few say that we have done things fundamentally wrong and that the institutions and values which motivated us to do those things need to be changed. It will be concluded that only if we change our unnatural design of money to a more natural one, will we be able to reach these goals"

    "abstract": "Forty years of innovations have greatly improved Helmet-Mounted Displays (HMDs) and their integration into military systems. However, a significant issue with HMDs is the effect of vibration and the associated Vestibulo-Ocular Reflex (VOR). When a human’s head is subject to low-frequency vibration, the VOR stabilizes the eye with respect to objects in the external environment. However, this response is inappropriate in HMDs as the display moves with the user’s head and the VOR blurs the image as it is projected on the human retina. Current compensation techniques suggest increasing the size of displayed graphics or text to compensate for the loss of perceived resolution, which reduces the benefit of advanced high-definition HMDs. While limited research has been done on the VOR in real world settings, this research sought to understand and describe the VOR in the presence of head slued imagery as a function of whole body low-frequency vibration. An experimental HMD was designed and developed to allow a user to perform visual tasks, while also recording and tracking eye movements via video recording and EOG. A human subject experiment was executed to collect initial data on the effect of vibration on eye movements while performing simple tasks chosen to isolate specific eye motions. The results indicate that when fixating on a stationary target, the magnitude of eye movement was greatest at 4-6 Hz of, before steadily decreasing beyond this range. The addition of motion to this target increased the magnitude at 4-6 Hz. The findings are consistent with previous research, which has found a decline in visual performance in this frequency range."

    "abstract": "Sir Josiah Stamp, a former director of the Bank of England, is quoted on the first page of Irving Fisher’s (1932) book “Booms and Depressions” as saying,“Money, as a physical medium of exchange, made a diversified civilization possible… And yet it is money, in its mechanical more than in its spiritual effects, which may well, having brought us to the present level, actually destroy society.” This sentence, written almost 100 years ago, has lost none of its relevance. Our money, as it is designed today, is unnatural, and so is the phenomenon of interest to which it gives rise. This insight goes as far back as Aristotle, who characterized money as a problematic man-made construct which could be subject to change. Like everything that deviates from the laws of nature, money causes many diseases that plague our world.\nOne might ask why I characterize our monetary system as unnatural. Well, while everything in nature is subject to the rhythmic cycle of growth and decay, only money seems to escape the transience of all earthly things, as Silvio Gesell (1949) wrote it in his masterpiece “The Natural Economic Order.” The unnatural storability of money gives rise to the economics of accumulation that Aristotle referred to as “chrematistics”: earning money as an end in itself. Since profits can be stored easily in the form of monetary units, this creates an incentive to produce more than is actually needed to satisfy fundamental human needs. The storability of money is also what gives rise to the phenomenon of interest, which Keynes described as a “reward for parting with liquidity.” Interest not only incentivizes the production of more than is needed but essentially requires us to do so. This is the root cause of many of the main challenges the world faces today, including unsustainability and income inequality. Unfortunately, very few scholars understand the linkage between these problems and the design of our monetary system. This book connects these dots and shows how these problems are rooted in our current monetary system. It also presents a solution."

    "abstract": "Originally published in 1989, Universities, Education and the National Economy looks at changes in the structure of British industry, which have brought into question the traditional role of universities in the economy. The emphasis on high technology in many emerging industries has prompted a closer relationship between science-based industries and the science departments of many leading universities. However, such co-operation is not always so apparent, and the emphasis in many universities on the wider aspects of education at the expense of a straightforward vocationalism remains a stumbling block. This book makes it clear however that it is not just a case of academic idealism vying with industrial philistinism. These essays, each of them by a leading figure in the world of higher education, emphasize the complexity of the relationship between the universities and economy. The authors discuss how difficult it has been to establish and effective dialogue between the educational and economic spheres and to decide what exactly it is that the latter requires of the former. The successes that have been achieved to date are highlighted and the problems that remain are analysed."

Αρχικά παρουσιάζονται οι ασύρματες τεχνολογίες που αποτελούν τον πυλώνα των τηλεπικοινωνιών. Στη συνέχεια αναλύεται η πορεία και η μετάβαση από την 1η γενιά ασύρματων δικτύων μέχρι και την σημερινή εποχή, όπου βρισκόμαστε στο νέο δίκτυο 5G. Η τεχνολογία 5G πρόκειται να προσφέρει υψηλές ταχύτητες μετάδοσης δεδομένων, αξιόπιστη λειτουργία, εξοικονόμηση ενέργειας και δυνατότητα διασύνδεσης διαφόρων συσκευών σε ένα ενιαίο δίκτυο. Για την επίτευξη αυτών των χαρακτηριστικών, είναι απαραίτητο να δημιουργηθούν δίκτυα που θα είναι ικανά να ανταποκριθούν στις απαιτήσεις του νέου συστήματος τηλεπικοινωνιών. Επιπλέον, η πέμπτη γενιά τηλεπικοινωνιών αναμένεται να αλλάξει ριζικά πολλούς κλάδους όπως η αυτοκινητοβιομηχανία, η ενέργεια, η γεωργία, η διαχείριση της πόλης, η υγειονομική περίθαλψη, η εκπαίδευση και θα σχεδιαστούν έτσι ώστε να έχουν τη δυνατότητα να υποστηρίξουν το Διαδίκτυο των Πραγμάτων (Internet of Things – IoT), ανοίγοντας έτσι νέους ορίζοντες για υπηρεσίες και εφαρμογές. Παρ’ όλα αυτά, ο δρόμος προς την επίτευξη του οράματος 5G δικτύων είναι δύσκολος, καθώς χρειάζεται να ξεπεραστούν πολλά εμπόδια, προκειμένου οι στόχοι του 5G να πραγματοποιηθούν. Τέλος, δίνεται έμφαση στους κινδύνους που εγκυμονούν από τα δίκτυα πέμπτης γενιάς αλλά και την εξέλιξη που αναμένεται να επιτευχθεί με τις νέες τεχνολογίες που το ανερχόμενο δίκτυο 6G θα ενσωματώνει. In this work we will study and develop the operation of the new 5G network and the important influences that this may bring to our daily lives. First, the wireless technologies that form the pillar of telecommunications are presented. Then it analyzes the course and transition from the 1st generation of wireless networks up to the present day, where we are in the new 5G network. The 5G technology offers high data transmission speeds, reliable operation, energy efficiency and the ability to connect various devices into a unified network To achieve these characteristics, it is necessary to create networks capable of meeting the requirements of the new telecommunications system. In addition, the fifth generation of telecommunications is expected to radically change many sectors such as automotive, energy, agriculture, city management, healthcare, education and will be designed to be able to support the Internet of Things (IoT), opening up new horizons for services and applications. Nevertheless, the road to achieving the vision of 5G networks is difficult, as many obstacles need to be overcome in order for 5G’s goals to be realized. Finally, emphasis is placed on the risks posed by fifth generation networks and the evolution that is expected to be achieved with the new technologies that the emerging 6G network will incorporate."

    "abstract": "A democratic deficit affects both the institutions regulating international economies and the European Union’s governance and strategies. At the level of single states, democratic representation tends to be bypassed or undermined by the so called ‘privatization of politics’. Together with the economic crisis starting in 2007–2008, a deep crisis of democracy seems to be the outcome of three decades of neoliberal policies. This topic is examined after an introductory analysis–in the section that follows–of a case in which economic and political aspects of the crisis are clearly intertwined. The combination of economic uneasiness with the decay of democracy seriously reduces the ‘capabilities’ of the great majority of people, and thereby, according to Amartya Sen, their ‘substantive freedoms’(Sen 1999a; 1999b). The final section turns to the holistic, opensystem and normative approach that has marked the radical ‘institutional’economic theory in order to raise the issue of positive freedom as an issue concerning society as a whole. On one hand, in Charles Lindblom’s words (2001: 190),‘people are not free’if they are excluded from important collective choices they are concerned with. On the other, in Karl Polanyi’s words (1977: xliii), the very survival of human society depends on its ‘freedom of creative adjustment’. The crisis gives us at least the opportunity to grasp the gravity and urgency of this issue."

A seguir o grupo GB foi submetido a exercício físico em roda giratória angulada montada sobre eixo articulado por 5 minutos durante 3 dias consecutivos. Decorridos quatro dias de experimento, os animais do (GB) foram submetidos à única sessão de exercício por 45 minutos. Após foram realizados eutanásia e coleta das amostras. A avaliação do estresse oxidativo foi realizada por meio da mensuração dos níveis de malondiadeído pelo método do TBA. As amostras foram lidas em espectrofotômetro a 535nm.\nResultados\nA análise de MDA intergrupos evidenciou aumento não significativo na comparação entre os tecidos avaliados. Diferença significativa foi observada na comparação intragrupo para o GA (p = 0,0201). Evidenciaram-se valores significantemente inferiores no músculo cardíaco em relação ao plasma. A análise de variância do GB apontou diferença significativa entre os tecidos (p = 0,0009), com valores menores no músculo cardíaco em relação ao plasma (p<0,001), e maiores no músculo estriado em relação ao músculo cardíaco ( p<0,05).\nConclusão\nO exercício físico aeróbico promoveu aumento não significativo sobre os níveis de estresse oxidativo em camundongos."
